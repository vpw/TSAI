ERA V5 Assignment 2 Reference Solution

This folder contains a reproducible reference solution for the multilingual BPE tokenizer assignment.

The goal was to build one shared tokenizer with a 10,000-token vocabulary for India Wikipedia pages in:

    English
    Hindi
    Telugu
    Maithili

The evaluation corpus here uses a wiki-faithful Markdown conversion rather than clipped article prose. Links, URLs, tables, references, image links, navboxes, and categories are preserved where the HTML-to-Markdown conversion emits them.
Result
Language	Tokens	Faithful Units	Fertility
English	111,390	186,367	0.597692
Hindi	51,190	88,359	0.579341
Telugu	24,428	36,292	0.673096
Maithili	4,258	5,808	0.733127

Spread = 0.733127 - 0.579341 = 0.153786
Raw score = 1000 / 0.153786 = 6502.56
Hindi penalty factor = 1.000000
Hindi-adjusted score = 6502.56

All four ratios satisfy the 1.2 threshold under the faithful-unit denominator:

English = 0.597692
Hindi   = 0.579341
Telugu  = 0.673096
Maithili= 0.733127

The tokenizer also round-trips punctuation and number separators. For example, India's population is 1,428,627,663. decodes back to the same string.

Faithfulness Requirement

The submitted tokenizer must preserve visible text:

decode(encode(text)) must keep the same non-whitespace characters as text

Tokenizers that strip punctuation, brackets, URL characters, apostrophes, number separators, or other visible symbols are not acceptable for this faithful Markdown evaluation. They may produce low token counts, but those counts are invalid because the tokenizer is not representing the same input.

Setup

Install dependencies:

pip install tokenizers regex requests beautifulsoup4 lxml markdownify

Rebuild the Corpus

python build_wiki_faithful_markdown.py

This fetches Wikipedia REST HTML and writes:

corpus/en.faithful.md
corpus/hi.faithful.md
corpus/te.faithful.md
corpus/mai.faithful.md

The corpus counts may change if Wikipedia pages change. The included corpus snapshots are the ones used to produce the metrics above.
Train the Tokenizer

python train_tokenizer.py

Training choices:

    Model: HuggingFace BPE
    Vocab size: 10,000
    min_frequency=1
    Normalizer: NFKC only
    Pretokenizer: Metaspace, using ▁ as the space marker
    Decoder: Metaspace
    Training weights:

{
  "en": 3,
  "hi": 4,
  "te": 4,
  "mai": 2
}

The tokenizer preserves punctuation, brackets, URL characters, apostrophes, number separators, and spaces through the Metaspace pretokenizer/decoder. This matters because the corpus is a faithful Markdown representation, not a plain word list. Metaspace is used instead of ByteLevel because ByteLevel spends too many tokens on UTF-8 bytes for Indic scripts.
Evaluate

python evaluate_tokenizer.py

The score formula is:

faithful_unit = one contiguous Unicode letter/mark/number run OR one visible non-space punctuation/symbol character
fertility(language) = token_count(language) / faithful_unit_count(language)
score = 1000 / (max_fertility - min_fertility)

The evaluator also prints a Hindi penalty score:

hindi_penalty = exp(max(0, hindi_fertility / 1.2 - 1))
hindi_adjusted_score = raw_score / hindi_penalty

Since this tokenizer has Hindi below 1.2, its Hindi penalty factor is 1.
Notes for Students

Do not report numbers from a clipped page or a hidden private corpus. The important part of this assignment is reproducibility.

A good submission should include:

    the exact tokenizer file
    code or clear method used to build it
    the exact Wikipedia corpus extraction process
    token counts for all four languages
    fertility ratios
    raw score calculation
    a live widget or notebook that lets the grader inspect/download the tokenizer

If your tokenizer relies on a custom JSON format, include the encoder code. A vocab list without the actual encoding algorithm is not enough to reproduce your score.
