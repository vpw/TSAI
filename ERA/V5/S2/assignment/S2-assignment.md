Assignment

Your assignment would be to pick India's page on Wikipedia in English, Hindi, Telugu, and one more language of your choice. Ask your AI Agent to design a BPE tokenizer in such a way that:

- you have 10000 tokens (your vocab) overall for all languages,
- (Total English Vocab, say 5000 words)/(Total English tokens) must be around 1.2 or less, let's call this X1
- Similarly ratios for your Hingi, Telugu and another language is X2, X3, X4
- Sort X1, X2, X3, X4.. say its X4 (largest), X2, X3, X1 (least).
- Your assignment score is going to be 1000/(X4 - X1).

What are you submitting:

- A Widget that shows these ratios, token statistics and calculations and your self score
- Allows me to see your tokenizer (list of all tokens)
- URL for this widget on Netlify (or anywhere else you want to host)
