# Session 11: Optimizers and Learning-Rate Schedules

Captured verbatim (rendered text) from the Axiom lesson page via `get_page_text`.
MathJax renders each formula twice on the page (a spelled-out form then a glyph run) and
tables are flattened to rows — both are artifacts of capturing rendered text, not an
editing choice. Widget captions are included inline where the page states them; the
widgets' live interactive state is not captured here (see CLAUDE.md on whether that
matters for this assignment).

## 1. Introduction

Session 10 defined the training step as five lines of code, one of which was left
unspecified. `loss.backward()` computes a gradient for every weight, and
`optimizer.step()` then uses those gradients to move the weights, but how was never
explained. This session covers that. It begins from the observation that a gradient is
incomplete information.

A gradient specifies the direction in which a weight should move. It does not specify
the distance.

The gradient computed in Session 10 was 64. That value does not prescribe a movement of
64, or of 0.64, or of any particular size. It gives a direction and a relative urgency,
and the distance is a separate decision. Every method in this session is a different rule
for making that decision.

| Method | How it sets the distance | Section |
|---|---|---|
| learning rate | one fixed value for every weight | 3 |
| momentum | from an average of recent gradients | 4 |
| second moment | separately per weight, from its own gradient history | 5 |
| Adam | both of the above combined | 6 |
| weight decay | adds a constant pull towards zero | 7 |
| warmup | small at first, while the estimates are unreliable | 9 |
| schedule | decreasing over the course of the run | 10 |
| batch scaling | from the number of samples averaged | 11 |
| muP | from the width of the model | 12 |
| Muon | from the shape of the weight matrix | 13 |

```

The methods appear in the order in which they were developed, because each one corrects a
specific failure of the one before it.

## 2. Terminology

Five terms recur throughout the session, each given here with a representative value.

- **Learning rate**, written η, is the factor that converts a gradient into a distance.
  For a model of our size it usually lies near 0.0003.
- A **hyperparameter** is a setting we choose before training rather than learn during
  it. The learning rate is one, and the batch size from Session 10 is another.
- **Optimizer state** is any quantity the optimizer stores about a weight between steps.
  Plain gradient descent stores none. The two values in the Session 10 widget are
  optimizer state, and Section 6 identifies them.
- An **epoch** is one complete pass over the training data. Our run makes roughly one
  pass, so steps rather than epochs are the useful unit.
- A **schedule** is a rule that varies the learning rate over the course of training, and
  it is the subject of Section 10.

Carry this forward: the learning rate is the most consequential single number in the
run, and the rest of this session exists to constrain how it is set.

## 3. Gradient Descent

The simplest rule that uses a gradient moves each weight against it by a fixed fraction.

`w ← w − η·g`

This is gradient descent. Take one weight starting at 0, and a loss `L = (w − 5)²` that is
smallest when the weight reaches 5. Its gradient is `2(w − 5)`, the 2 coming from
differentiating the square.

Call the distance still to travel `d = w − 5`. Substituting that gradient into the update
rule and then subtracting 5 from both sides gives the distance after one step:

```
w_new     = w − η·2(w − 5)
w_new − 5 = (w − 5) − 2η(w − 5)
d_new     = d·(1 − 2η)
```

The `(w − 5)` factors out and leaves a single number multiplying it, so every step
shrinks or grows the remaining distance by the same factor `(1 − 2η)`, and the whole
behaviour of the run is decided by that one number.

That factor carries two separate pieces of information. Its sign says which side of the
minimum the weight lands on: positive and it stayed on the side it started, negative and
it crossed over, which is an overshoot. Its magnitude says whether the distance shrank or
grew: below 1 and the weight is closer than before, above 1 and it is further away.
Convergence therefore needs `|1 − 2η| < 1`, which for this loss means η between 0 and 1.

| η | multiplier | w over five steps |
|---|---|---|
| 0.01 | +0.98 | 0.10, 0.20, 0.29, 0.39, 0.48 |
| 0.10 | +0.80 | 1.00, 1.80, 2.44, 2.95, 3.36 |
| 0.90 | −0.80 | 9.00, 1.80, 7.56, 2.95, 6.64 |
| 1.10 | −1.20 | 11.0, −2.2, 13.6, −5.4, 17.4 |

Four different behaviours from one number. At 0.01 the weight crawls and will need
several hundred steps. At 0.10 it converges cleanly. At 0.90 it overshoots the target
every step but the overshoot shrinks, so it still converges. At 1.10 the overshoot grows
instead, and the weight is further from the target after five steps than when it started.

The same three lines work on any loss of this shape. If the gradient is `c·d` rather than
`2d`, the multiplier comes out as `(1 − ηc)`, where `c` measures how sharply the loss
bends around its minimum. We call `c` the **curvature**, and it was 2 in the example
above. Convergence requires `|1 − ηc| < 1`, so the safe range for η is set by the
curvature.

A real loss does not have one curvature. It bends sharply along some directions and
gently along others, and a single η has to serve all of them. Consider

`L = ½(20u² + v²)`

which has curvature 20 along u and curvature 1 along v. Starting from (1, 1), each step
multiplies u by `(1 − 20η)` and v by `(1 − η)`, read exactly as above.

| η | u multiplier | v multiplier | after five steps |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.01 | +0.80 | 0.99 | u is converging, v has barely moved at 0.951 |
| 0.09 | −0.80 | 0.91 | u overshoots every step, v is still slow at 0.624 |
| 0.11 | −1.20 | 0.89 | u has diverged to −2.49 and is growing |

The value that suits u leaves v almost stationary, and the value that moves v makes u
diverge. This is the failure the next three sections correct.

Carry this forward: one learning rate shared by every weight is the first assumption
to break, because the weights do not share a curvature.

*Widget — "Gradient descent in two dimensions."* Raise the learning rate and the steep
direction starts to oscillate and then diverges, while the shallow direction is still
crawling.

## 4. Momentum

A weight whose gradient has kept the same sign over many steps can safely be moved
further than one whose gradient alternates. Using that fact requires a record of recent
gradients whose size does not grow with the number of steps.

An **exponential moving average** keeps a single running value and mixes each new
observation into it by a fixed fraction:

`m ← β1·m + (1 − β1)·g`

The fraction β1 is a hyperparameter and is almost always 0.9. Each new gradient then
contributes one tenth while the existing average keeps nine tenths. A gradient's share is
multiplied by β1 on every later step, so it has faded to almost nothing after about
`1/(1 − β1) = 10` steps, and that is the sense in which m remembers the last ten gradients
while storing one number.

The two directions of Section 3 produce gradients of two characteristic shapes. Along the
steep direction the sign flips on every step, because the weight lands past the minimum
each time. Along the shallow direction the sign never changes, because the weight
approaches the minimum from one side and never reaches it.

Take the cleanest version of each shape, one alternating between +1 and −1 and one
holding at a constant +0.2, five times smaller.

| step | steep direction | shallow direction |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.100 | 0.020 |
| 2 | −0.010 | 0.038 |
| 3 | 0.091 | 0.054 |
| 4 | −0.018 | 0.069 |
| 5 | 0.084 | 0.082 |

The alternating gradients cancel each other while the constant one accumulates, so after
five steps the two averages are nearly equal despite a fivefold difference in the
gradients themselves. Momentum is the use of m in place of g in the update rule.

Carry this forward: an exponential moving average cancels what alternates and
accumulates what is consistent.

*Widget — "Momentum."* Enter gradients by hand and the average follows them, then apply
it to the surface from Section 3 and move β1 from 0 to 0.99.

## 5. Per-Parameter Learning Rates

Momentum still leaves every weight sharing one learning rate, and the weights of a
language model differ enormously in how often they receive a gradient at all. Session 7
gives the clearest case. The embedding row for a common word receives a large gradient in
almost every batch, while the row for a rare word may receive none across a thousand
batches. One learning rate cannot suit both.

The weights of a model are also called its **parameters**, and the fix is to give each
parameter a learning rate of its own, computed from its own gradient history. We keep a
second exponential moving average, this time over the squared gradient, which estimates
how large that parameter's gradients typically are:

`v ← β2·v + (1 − β2)·g²`

The subscript distinguishes it from β1 above, and β2 is almost always 0.999, so by the
same `1/(1 − β2)` count this average spans about a thousand gradients rather than ten. If
a parameter's gradient holds steady at g, the average settles on g², so √v settles on
|g|, which is where the two values in the table below come from.

The step is then divided by √v, and writing the update out shows what that does:

`w ← w − (η/√v)·g`

The quantity η/√v is a learning rate belonging to that parameter alone, and it is what
gives this section its name. For two parameters, one receiving a gradient of 1.0 on
every step and one receiving 0.01, after two hundred steps:

| quantity | Parameter A | Parameter B |
|---|---|---|
| gradient g | 1.0000 | 0.0100 |
| √v | 1.0000 | 0.0100 |
| its own learning rate, η/√v | 1.00 η | 100.00 η |
| resulting step, ηg/√v | 1.0000 η | 1.0000 η |

Parameter B has been given a learning rate a hundred times larger than Parameter A's, and
the two then take exactly the same step. The division removes the magnitude of the
gradient and keeps only its sign and its consistency. A parameter that has been inactive
for a thousand steps therefore takes a full-sized step when a gradient finally arrives,
which is what a rare word's embedding requires.

Carry this forward: η/√v is a separate learning rate for every parameter, and it gives
them all the same step size whatever their gradients.

*Widget — "Per-parameter learning rates."* Two parameters with gradients a hundred times
apart, and the learning rate each one is given, before and after the division.

## 6. Adam

Adam combines the two averages. The first sets the direction of the step, the second sets
its scale, and a correction removes a bias they share.

Both averages start at zero, so their early values are pulled towards zero and read too
low. Feed a constant gradient g into the first average and after t steps it has reached
`m_t = g·(1 − β1^t)`, short of g by exactly the factor `(1 − β1^t)`. Dividing by that
factor restores it, and the same argument applies to v. This is **bias correction**, and
it is exact rather than approximate.

It matters most at the first step, because β2 = 0.999 is much closer to 1 than β1 = 0.9
and the two averages are therefore pulled down by very different amounts. At t = 1 we
have `m1 = 0.1·g` and `v1 = 0.001·g²`, so without the correction:

`m1/√v1 = 0.1g / (0.0316|g|) = 3.16`

while with it the two corrections cancel and the ratio is exactly `g/|g| = 1`.

| at step 1, with g = 0.5 | step taken |
|---|---|
| without bias correction | 3.16 η |
| with bias correction | 1.00 η |

The complete rule is

`w ← w − η · m̂/(√v̂ + ε)`

where ε is a very small constant, usually 10⁻⁸, added only so that a weight whose
gradients have all been zero is not divided by zero. Computed by hand for five steps at
η = 0.001:

| t | g | m | v | m̂ | v̂ | step | w |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.50 | 0.0500 | 0.000250 | 0.5000 | 0.2500 | −0.001000 | 0.999000 |
| 2 | 0.40 | 0.0850 | 0.000410 | 0.4474 | 0.2050 | −0.000988 | 0.998012 |
| 3 | 0.60 | 0.1365 | 0.000769 | 0.5037 | 0.2567 | −0.000994 | 0.997018 |
| 4 | 0.45 | 0.1678 | 0.000971 | 0.4881 | 0.2431 | −0.000990 | 0.996028 |
| 5 | 0.55 | 0.2061 | 0.001273 | 0.5032 | 0.2550 | −0.000996 | 0.995031 |

The step column follows from the two averages. Once both are corrected, m̂ is close to the
recent average gradient and √v̂ is close to its typical size, so their ratio sits near ±1
and the step sits near ±η. The gradients range from 0.40 to 0.60, while every step falls
within half a percent of 0.001, which is the learning rate itself. This is the property
that made Adam the default: the gradient sets the direction and the learning rate sets
the distance, and the two decisions stop interfering with each other.

m and v are the two values stored in the Session 10 widget.

Carry this forward: Adam moves every weight by approximately η, whatever the magnitude
of its gradient.

*Widget — "Adam, one weight, five steps."* Every intermediate value as it is computed,
with bias correction switchable so the first step moves between 1.00 and 3.16 times η.

## 7. Weight Decay and AdamW

Weights tend to grow over a long run, and large weights make a model brittle. The
established remedy is **L2 regularization**, which adds a penalty for magnitude directly
to the loss:

`L_total = L + ½λw²`

The derivative of that penalty is `λw`, which joins the gradient. Under plain gradient
descent it shrinks every weight by the same fraction on each step. Under Adam it does
not, because that added `λw` is divided by √v̂ along with everything else.

For two weights, both sitting at 0.5, with λ = 0.1 and η = 0.001, the decoupled amount is
`ηλw = 0.001 × 0.1 × 0.5 = 5.0×10⁻⁵`, and the L2 route is that same amount divided by √v̂:

| parameter | √v̂ | shrinkage per step |
|---|---|---|
| A | 1.00 | 5.0×10⁻⁵ |
| B | 0.01 | 5.0×10⁻³ |

Parameter B is decayed a hundred times more strongly than Parameter A, for a reason
unconnected to how large it is. How much regularization a weight receives has become a
function of its gradient history.

**AdamW** applies the shrinkage separately, after the Adam step, where nothing divides
it:

`w ← w − η·m̂/(√v̂ + ε) − ηλw`

Both weights above then shrink by 5.0×10⁻⁵.

A further consequence was established in 2025. The decoupled term makes the final weights
an exponential moving average of the updates applied along the way, with a timescale of
`1/(ηλ)` steps. At η = 0.0003 and λ = 0.1 that is `1/(0.0003 × 0.1) = 33,333` steps, so the
model we finish with is an average over roughly the last thirty thousand steps of
training. It follows that η and λ are not two independent settings. Their product is the
setting.

We exclude normalization scales and biases from decay, because shrinking them changes
what the layer computes rather than how large it is.

Carry this forward: decoupled decay shrinks every weight equally, and ηλ determines
how far back the finished model averages.

*Widget — "L2 against decoupled decay."* The same weight down both routes, identical
while its gradients are large and a hundred times apart when they are small.

## 8. Optimizer Memory Cost

Session 10 counted sixteen bytes for every weight in training. Two of the five entries in
that count belong to the optimizer, and Section 6 identified them.

| What is stored | Bytes |
|---|---|
| the weight, in bf16 | 2 |
| its gradient, in bf16 | 2 |
| a full-precision copy, in fp32 | 4 |
| m, the gradient average | 4 |
| v, the squared-gradient average | 4 |
| total | 16 |

Half the training memory is optimizer state, so the choice of rule changes the bill
directly. A 9B model at 16 bytes a weight needs `9×10⁹ × 16 = 144×10⁹` bytes, and dividing
by 2³⁰ turns that into gibibytes:

| Optimizer | Bytes per weight | A 9B model |
|---|---|---|
| gradient descent | 8 | 67.1 GiB |
| with momentum | 12 | 100.6 GiB |
| AdamW | 16 | 134.1 GiB |
| 8-bit AdamW | 10 | 83.8 GiB |

The 8-bit variant stores m and v in one byte each with a shared scale, using the
block-scaling method from Session 10, and saves 50 GiB on a 9B model.

Carry this forward: the optimizer is half of the memory required to hold a model in
training.

*Widget — "Optimizer state memory."* Vary the model size and the choice of rule, and
each one crosses the capacity of an 80 GB card at a different point.

## 9. Learning Rate Warmup

The warmup in this section is a different thing from the mixture warmup band of Sessions
5 and 6, which blended a change of data distribution. Here we are ramping the learning
rate itself.

Section 6 established that Adam moves each weight by approximately η. That approximation
depends on how consistent the gradients have been:

| gradient behaviour | resulting step |
|---|---|
| same sign on every step | 1.000 η |
| noisy, averaging to zero | 0.281 η |

The first row is the exact case from Section 6: a gradient of unchanging sign makes m̂ and
√v̂ equal, so the ratio is 1. The second is measured rather than derived, by running the
same rule on gradients drawn independently with mean zero, where m̂ largely cancels while
√v̂ does not.

Through most of a run the gradients disagree with each other and every weight takes a
fraction of η. At the start of a run they agree, because the model is randomly
initialized and almost every weight is wrong in the same direction, so every weight takes
close to the full step, repeatedly.

Weights are initialized at a scale of `1/√fan-in`, so that a layer's output has about the
same size as its input however wide it is. At d_model = 4,096 that is `1/√4096 = 0.0156`.
A full step of η = 0.0003 therefore moves a weight by

`0.0003 / 0.0156 = 0.0192`

of its own size, on the first step, in a direction chosen by an untrained model. A
healthy run sits near 0.001, so the starting value is nineteen times too large. Warmup
corrects this by raising η from near zero over the first few thousand steps, during which
the gradients become less correlated.

That ratio, the size of the update divided by the size of the weight, logged per layer,
is the quantity to monitor. It should stay near 10⁻³ for the whole run.

Carry this forward: warmup is needed because early gradients are correlated, and
correlated gradients produce Adam's largest possible step.

*Widget — "Learning rate warmup."* The update-to-weight ratio over 10,000 steps. The
largest ratio the run ever sees falls from 19.2e-3 without warmup to 2.83e-3 with it.

## 10. Learning Rate Schedules

Warmup fixes the first part of the learning rate's trajectory, and the rest of it must
also be specified. Large steps early cover distance quickly and small steps late let the
model settle, so every schedule rises and then falls. They differ in the shape of the
fall.

**Cosine decay** brings the learning rate from its peak to near zero along a cosine
curve. It has been the standard choice for several years and it performs well, but it
carries a structural constraint. The curve is defined in terms of the total number of
steps, so the length of the run must be fixed before the first step is taken. A run
stopped early has not completed its decay, and the model it leaves behind is worse than
one trained to that shorter length deliberately.

**WSD**, for warmup, stable and decay, holds the peak rate flat for an unspecified
duration and decays only over the final few percent of the run. Because the flat phase
has no predetermined end, we can save the weights at any point, which is called a
**checkpoint**, and decay separately from there. One run therefore yields finished models
at many budgets and can continue afterwards.

```
flowchart LR
W["warmup, ~2% of steps"] --> S["stable, flat, any length"] --> D["decay, last ~10%"]
S --> C["checkpoint here, and decay separately"]
```

A result published in 2026 goes further. Holding the learning rate constant for the whole
run while keeping an exponential moving average of the weights, which is the mechanism of
Section 4 applied to w rather than to g, produces averaged weights that match cosine at
every point along the run. The decay phase and weight averaging turn out to serve the
same purpose, which is suppressing noise over the final stretch. This has been measured
at 150M and 300M parameters and not at our scale, so it stays unconfirmed for a run of
our size.

Carry this forward: cosine needs the length of the run in advance and WSD does not,
which matters more than any difference in final loss.

*Widget — "Schedule comparison."* Cosine, WSD and constant with weight averaging on one
axis. Move the stopping point and each shape yields a different quality of model.

## 11. Batch Size and Learning Rate Scaling

Session 10 established that the global batch size is chosen independently of what fits in
memory. That choice has a consequence, because it changes the appropriate learning rate.

A gradient computed from a batch is an estimate, and averaging more samples improves it.
The average of N independent samples carries `1/√N` of the noise of a single one, so
against a batch of 8 the noise is `√(8/N)`. At V4's batch of 56 that is `√(8/56) = 0.378`:

| global batch | noise, relative to 8 |
|---|---|
| 8 | 1.000 |
| 32 | 0.500 |
| 56, which V4 used | 0.378 |
| 128 | 0.250 |
| 512 | 0.125 |

A more accurate gradient can be trusted over a longer step, so a larger batch supports a
larger learning rate. For gradient descent the relationship is linear, and four times the
batch permits four times the rate. For Adam it is the square root, and four times the
batch permits twice the rate, because Adam has already divided out the magnitude of the
gradient and only its consistency remains.

Two separate mechanisms raise the global batch, and the learning rate distinguishes
neither of them. Session 10 built gradient accumulation, which runs several micro-batches
one after another and steps once at the end. Data parallelism runs those micro-batches at
the same time on several GPUs and averages their gradients before the step. To the
optimizer these are the same change.

`global batch = micro-batch × GPUs × accumulation steps`

V4 ran a micro-batch of 7 on each of 8 GPUs with no accumulation, which is where its
global batch of 56 comes from.

| Change | Global batch | Learning rate under Adam |
|---|---|---|
| accumulation steps from 1 to 4 | x4 | x2 |
| GPUs from 8 to 32 | x4 | x2 |
| both together | x16 | x4 |

The trap is in how the gradients are combined. Data parallelism averages across GPUs, so
nothing further is required. Accumulation adds, so the sum has to be divided before the
step, and Session 10 showed that dividing by the number of micro-batches instead of by
the number of tokens is itself a bug. Getting this wrong multiplies the learning rate by
the accumulation count without anyone having chosen to.

Both relationships have a limit. Past a threshold called the **critical batch size** the
gradient is already accurate enough that more samples buy almost nothing, and the extra
compute is spent for no return. Where that threshold sits is a property of the model and
the data, and it has to be measured.

Carry this forward: under Adam, four times the batch permits twice the learning rate,
up to the critical batch size. More GPUs and more accumulation steps are the same
change, because only the global batch enters the rule.

*Widget — "Batch size and learning rate."* The linear rule against the square-root rule,
and the point at which doubling the batch produces no further improvement.

## 12. Hyperparameter Transfer (muP)

Finding the learning rate by sweeping it on a small model and applying the result to a
large one would be inexpensive, but it is not valid, because the best learning rate
depends on the width of the model. Under the standard parameterization it varies roughly
in inverse proportion to width:

| width | approximate best η |
|---|---|
| 256 | 3.0×10⁻³ |
| 512 | 1.5×10⁻³ |
| 1,024 | 7.5×10⁻⁴ |
| 2,048 | 3.8×10⁻⁴ |
| 4,096 | 1.9×10⁻⁴ |

Carrying the value from width 256 across to width 4,096 would overstate it by a factor of
sixteen.

**muP** changes how the initialization scale and the per-layer learning rates depend on
width, so that this dependence cancels. Under it the curve of loss against learning rate
has its minimum at the same value at every width, and a sweep at width 256 therefore
determines the value for width 4,096. The same transfer has been demonstrated for weight
decay, at model sizes of several billion parameters.

For this run the difference is one day of small sweeps against one estimate.

Carry this forward: muP does not improve the model. It makes the small model's
measurement valid for the large one.

*Widget — "Learning rate transfer."* Loss against learning rate at four widths, with the
minima drifting leftwards under the standard parameterization and aligning under muP.

## 13. Matrix Optimizers: Muon, MuonClip, Hyperball

Adam treats a weight matrix as a collection of independent numbers and scales each one
separately. A matrix is not a collection of independent numbers. It maps an input vector
to an output vector, and it amplifies some input directions more than others. Those
amplification factors are the matrix's singular values, and when a few of them are much
larger than the rest, nearly all of the matrix's effect is confined to a few directions
while the others contribute very little.

The momentum matrix has exactly this property. **Muon** replaces it with the nearest
matrix whose singular values are all equal to 1, so every direction is updated by the
same amount. It stores only m, which puts it at 12 bytes per weight against AdamW's 16.

The reported results:

| Finding | 2026 |
|---|---|
| Speedup over a well tuned AdamW | 1.4x at 0.1B, falling to 1.1x at 1.2B |
| Tokens to reach the same loss at very large batches | 10 to 15% fewer |
| Batch size at which AdamW destabilises and Muon holds | around 100M tokens |
| Kimi K2, one trillion parameters | 15.5T tokens, zero loss spikes |

The first row governs the decision. Most published two-fold speedups were measured
against an AdamW baseline that had not been tuned to the same standard. When both sides
are tuned equally the advantage is real but modest, and it decreases as the model grows.

Muon introduces a failure of its own. Making every direction equally strong lets the
query and key matrices grow without limit, and the attention scores of Session 8 then
rise past 1,000, at which point the softmax saturates and the run fails. **MuonClip**
rescales the query and key matrices directly after each update, so the correction lands
on the weights rather than after the softmax. This is the mechanism that carried Kimi K2
through 15.5 trillion tokens without a loss spike.

**Hyperball**, published in June 2026, replaces weight decay's indirect control of matrix
magnitude with a direct projection onto a fixed magnitude after every step. It reports 20
to 30% over AdamW at 1.2B, increasing with the length of the run, against approximately
10% for Muon with conventional decay.

One constraint holds across every recipe that has been shown to work. Muon is applied
only to two-dimensional weight matrices. Embeddings, normalization scales and the output
head stay on AdamW, because they do not amplify directions and the argument does not
apply to them.

Carry this forward: a reported speedup is a statement about someone else's baseline
until both sides have been tuned to the same standard.

## 14. V5 Decisions

This session settles four decisions. We train with AdamW and decoupled decay, excluding
normalization scales and biases from it. We warm up over the first few thousand steps,
and we log the update-to-weight ratio per layer from step one, alongside the grad norm
that Session 10 put on the dashboard. We treat ηλ as one setting rather than two. The
schedule is WSD, because the run has to be able to stop, branch and continue.

Four decisions stay open.

| Question | What would settle it |
|---|---|
| AdamW or Muon for the two-dimensional matrices? | A matched short run at our real width with both sides tuned to the same standard, taking the 1.1x figure as the prior. |
| Whether to spend a day on a muP sweep at widths 256 to 2,048. | The sweep costs about one day and fixes every hyperparameter that follows, which makes it the highest-value day available to us. |
| One learning rate, or a separate one for the output head? | The head is 536.9M weights and dense. Log its update-to-weight ratio against the body's for a thousand steps and compare. |
| Whether to decay the Kronecker factors from Session 7. | No published result exists. This is an ablation the cohort can run. |

## 15. Assignment

1. Reproduce Adam by hand. Take one weight and five gradients, compute m, v, m̂, v̂ and the
   resulting step yourself, then check each against PyTorch. They should agree to several
   decimal places.
2. Disable bias correction and plot the first twenty steps both ways. Report the number
   of steps after which the difference stops mattering.
3. Log the update-to-weight ratio for every layer, and identify the step at which warmup
   stops changing it.
4. Train the same model twice for 300 steps, once under cosine and once under WSD, and
   stop both at step 200. Report both losses and state which model you would keep.
5. Sweep the learning rate at widths 256, 512 and 1,024, plot loss against learning rate,
   and mark the three minima. State the value you would use at width 4,096 and how
   confident you are in it.

Tune both sides before accepting a comparison. Almost every optimizer claim that failed
to replicate was a well tuned method measured against a badly tuned one.
