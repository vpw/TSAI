Assignment parts:

S1-1 · Activations exist for a reason.

Claim: a model with no nonlinearity can only draw a straight boundary, so it cannot separate two interleaved/concentric rings; adding one ReLU hidden layer can. 
Build: generate ~300 noisy 2D points as two rings (inner = class 0, outer = class 1), not linearly separable. 
Train (a) a single linear layer + sigmoid, (b) one ReLU hidden layer. 
Proof: plot both decision boundaries — the linear one is a straight line stuck near 55% accuracy, the ReLU one wraps the ring to ~99%. 
Only the activation changed. The boundary picture is the money shot.

S1-2 · Depth without nonlinearity is a lie.

Claim: five stacked linear layers collapse to a single linear map, so a 5-layer linear net is no stronger than 1 layer; both fail the ring task identically, and inserting ReLUs between the same five layers suddenly solves it. 
Build: same ring data; train 1 linear layer, 5 linear layers (no activations), then 5 layers + ReLU. 
Proof: the 1-layer and 5-linear-layer accuracies and boundaries are identical (both a line); ReLU breaks the tie. 
Bonus that nails it: multiply the five weight matrices numerically and show the product is one matrix.

S1-3 · Embeddings learn similarity from nothing but next-token.

Claim: trained only to predict the next token in a tiny synthetic grammar, the embedding table clusters related tokens, though similarity was never supplied. 
Build: a toy language with categories (animals: cat dog cow; fruits: apple mango; verbs: eat chase see) and templates like , so same-category tokens share next-token distributions. 
Train a tiny embedding→softmax next-token model. 
Proof: project the learned embeddings to 2D and plot — same-category tokens land together; nearest neighbors are same-category. Emergent clustering = the proof.

S1-4 · Memorization vs generalization, and data closes the gap.

Claim: a high-capacity model on tiny data drives train loss to ~0 while held-out loss stays high; growing the dataset closes the gap. 
Build: a learnable noisy classification with a held-out split; train an over-parameterized net at train sizes 20, 200, 2000. 
Proof: the train/test gap is huge at 20 (train→0, test bad) and shrinks as data grows — plot the generalization gap vs dataset size. Ties straight into the course's "data is everything."
