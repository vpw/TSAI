The assignment

This is an interesting one, and can help you and me to write a paper. This is the direction I am planning to write Kronecker Embedding V2 and these are the ideas. You can pick any of these and ponder, think, work with your agent, and suggest what you would do. I am stating the problems here, so you can work out your own solution. You somehow would need to prove your solution as well. For that you can ask your agent to write a small transformer model and train it. It will figure out
itself, don't worry. Here are the problems (each are separate, don't try and mix them):

1. What if embeddings can store mathematical structure as well. Say 9.. somehow it has stored the meaning of 9 (in absolute math terms), such that when we actually do 9 + 9, the mathematical mearning part of the embeddings is itself 18! When we do 9*9.. it becomes 81! How much can we push? Can we descibe whole mathematics and all mathematical operations using this? Of course we need some space for alphabets/words as well, for that we can use 32 existing spaces, and add this new concept into new ones (that are appended)!
2. What is the natural extension of Kronecker, such that it can represent images and audio as well!! Yes we'll need to do some preprocessing of image and autio patches as well, but how we do use this concept to represent all 3!
3. Today Kronecker is limiting to presenting 32 position for every work (even "apple" or "a" as well). That's a waste os space. What can we do? How can it be dynamic and doesn't force us to crop a word (currently we cannot have a word of len more than 32).
4. What is a REAL Fourier alternative of Kronecker? Why can't I represent each character like a fourier wave, and just add them to make a word!!
5. Kronecker is forward deterministic (same word will always give same embedding). How do I make a reverse of this (same embedding gives the same Kronecker)? If we can do this, then we can get rid of the final head as well! Then we can have a vocab of 1M as well without any issues!

So pick any of these problems and submit your solution! In solution do mention which problem you're solving and how are you proving that your solution will work. Need a good README to read (can be a webapp to show graphs, animations, etc else boring README also work) and definitely a code that proves your work.
