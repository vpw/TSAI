The page's text is ~58.9K characters, over `get_page_text`'s 50K cap, so it was read in two
passes: a full pass up to §16, then §15 to the end. Prose is kept verbatim. Tables were

## 0. Why this session exists at all

Session 12 divides storage. ZeRO takes the 16 bytes per weight and spreads the optimizer state,
the gradients and finally the weights across the copies. Every GPU still runs the whole model,
and every GPU still processes its own micro-batch from the first layer to the last.

Three things break under that arrangement, and each one is a section of Session 13.

- **ZeRO never divides activations.** One sequence of 8,192 tokens through our 30B model stores
  127.5 GiB of intermediate results. An H100 card holds 74.5 GiB. Take ZeRO-3 to its limit, put
  the entire training state at 16/N, and that one sequence still does not fit on one card. Tensor
  and pipeline parallelism divide the activations, because they divide the computation itself.
- **ZeRO-3 needs a whole layer to fit and rebuilds it every step.** It gathers each layer's full
  weights on every GPU just before use. That costs 3 parameter-sizes of traffic per step, and it
  assumes one layer's weights and one layer's work belong on one GPU.
- **One long sequence cannot be split by data parallelism.** A 131,072-token sequence produces
  2,040 GiB of activations. It is a single sample, so no number of data-parallel copies helps.
  Context parallelism is the answer.

Session 12 answers "our model's state does not fit". Session 13 answers "our model's computation
does not fit". Production runs use both at once: DeepSeek-V3 ran 16-way pipeline, 64-way expert
parallelism and ZeRO-1 together.

### Prelude to the whole session (instructor's informal notes, "Attempt 1" / "Attempt 2")

> ZeRO divides what is STORED.
> Tensor / Sequence / Pipeline / Context parallelism divide what is COMPUTED.

That distinction makes almost everything fall into place. Picture the model as a 1,000-page
textbook and 8 children (GPUs) studying it. Memory is consumed by:

```
MODEL TRAINING MEMORY
├── Weights          ← the actual model
├── Gradients        ← how weights should change
├── Optimizer state  ← Adam momentum, variance, etc.
└── Activations      ← temporary working memory created while processing the tokens
```

ZeRO attacks the first three. TP / SP / PP / CP attack the computation and, importantly,
activations.

**Normal data parallelism.** Every GPU gets a complete copy of the textbook and processes
different examples (`GPU k: [FULL MODEL] → Batch k`). Great for speed, terrible for memory:
weights, gradients and Adam state are all duplicated 8 times.

**ZeRO-1** ("Why is every GPU storing the same Adam optimizer state?"): weights FULL, gradients
FULL, optimizer 1/8. Computation hasn't changed: every GPU still runs layer 1 → 96 on its own
batch. *ZeRO-1 = memory trick. Not model-compute splitting.*

**ZeRO-2** ("Why are we duplicating gradients too?"): weights FULL, gradients 1/8, optimizer 1/8.
Every GPU still computes the entire model on different micro-batches.

**ZeRO-3** ("Why even duplicate the weights?"): at rest each GPU holds 1/8 of the weights. The
common confusion is to think GPU 0 now computes 1/8 of the model. It doesn't. When layer 17 must
execute, all GPUs all-gather layer 17's weights, the full layer temporarily exists, every GPU
computes layer 17 on its own micro-batch, and the weights are discarded. Then layer 18 is
gathered, computed and discarded, and so on. *ZeRO-3 divides model STORAGE, not the actual matrix
multiplication.* "This sentence is worth remembering."

**Tensor parallelism** ("split the matrix multiplication itself"). An 8192×8192 W with TP=8 gives
each GPU 1/8 of W. One token's input goes to all 8 GPUs, each multiplies its slice, and they
communicate to form the complete result. ZeRO-3 stores the weights divided, but each GPU computes
the full layer. TP stores the weights divided *and* divides the computation of the layer itself.
That is the critical distinction.

**Sequence parallelism.** With an activation of 4096 tokens × 8192 hidden, TP tends to split the
8192 hidden dimension. SP says: "For operations where tokens don't need to interact, let's also
divide the 4096 tokens." With SP=8 GPU0 holds tokens 1–512, GPU1 513–1024, …, GPU7 3585–4096, for
LayerNorm, dropout and some residual operations. That's why TP and SP are normally paired: TP
splits the HIDDEN dimension, SP splits the TOKEN dimension for suitable operations.

**Pipeline parallelism** ("Why does every GPU need to execute every layer?"). 96 layers on 8 GPUs:
GPU0 → layers 1–12, GPU1 → 13–24, …, GPU7 → 85–96. The activations flow GPU0 → GPU1 → … → GPU7.
GPU 0 never computes layers 13–96, which is very different from ZeRO-3, where every GPU computes
1 → 96.

**Context parallelism.** Training on 128,000 tokens makes attention enormous. With CP=8, GPU0
holds tokens 0–15,999, GPU1 16,000–31,999, …, GPU7 112,000–127,999. GPU0's tokens need to attend
to tokens living on other GPUs, so the GPUs exchange keys and values during attention. Its purpose
is primarily to make extremely long sequences manageable.

**One picture:**

```

                          SP  (helps activation memory)
```

| Technique | Child-level explanation |
| --- | --- |
| ZeRO-1 | Divide the optimizer notebooks |
| ZeRO-2 | Divide optimizer notebooks + gradients |
| ZeRO-3 | Divide optimizer + gradients + model weights while stored |
| Tensor Parallel | Divide each giant matrix multiplication |
| Sequence Parallel | Divide token activations for suitable per-token operations |
| Pipeline Parallel | Divide the model's layers |
| Context Parallel | Divide one enormous sequence across GPUs |

**Why doesn't ZeRO-3 solve everything?** A 1-trillion-parameter model with enough GPUs that ZeRO-3
makes the weights fit, and now you want 256K context. The activation tensor is gigantic and "ZeRO
says ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯", because ZeRO didn't divide activations. Then you may need CP to divide 256K
tokens, SP to reduce duplicated activation storage, TP to divide enormous matrix calculations,
and PP to divide 100+ layers.

**Five axes.** What can I divide? (1) Training state → ZeRO; (2) matrix width → TP; (3) layers /
depth → PP; (4) tokens / context → CP; (5) batch → DP; and, closely tied to #2, (6) activation
tokens → SP, during operations where token-wise splitting works. "That is really the entire
story."

**A concrete 64-GPU example.** 64 H200s with TP=8, PP=4, CP=2 (8×4×2 = 64): one training sample
is spread across all 64 GPUs. Pipeline stage 0 has 16 GPUs for layers 1–24 (CP=2 splits first and
second halves of the tokens, and TP=8 runs within each CP group). Stages 1–3 have layers 25–48,
49–72 and 73–96. With 512 GPUs, replicate that 64-GPU model 8 times (DP=8), and ZeRO operates across
those 8 replicas, sharding the optimizer and gradients and perhaps the params. That is why modern
large runs can say TP=8, PP=8, CP=4, DP=16, ZeRO / distributed optimizer enabled, Sequence
Parallel enabled. They're not alternatives. They cut completely different dimensions.

> ZeRO asks, "Where do I STORE the model's training state?" TP, PP and CP ask, "Which GPU
> actually COMPUTES which part of the model?"
>
> TP cuts a layer sideways, PP cuts the model vertically by layers, CP cuts the input sequence by
> tokens, and ZeRO cuts the duplicated training-state memory.

## 1. Introduction

A training run spreads its work across many GPUs. The simplest arrangement copies the whole model
onto every GPU and gives each copy different data. This arrangement is called data parallelism.
That arrangement stops working once a single copy of the model no longer fits on one GPU, or once
the working memory of a single long sequence no longer fits. This session covers the ways to
divide the model itself, and the sequence itself, across GPUs.

One model is used for every calculation. It has 30.2 billion parameters in 96 layers, with a
hidden size of 5,120 and 40 attention heads. An attention head is one of the parallel attention
calculations inside a layer, and each of ours works on 128 dimensions.

Training one weight requires more memory than the weight itself.

| What is stored for one weight | Bytes |
| --- | --- |
| the weight, in 16-bit format | 2 |
| its gradient, in 16-bit format | 2 |
| a 32-bit master copy of the weight | 4 |
| the optimizer's two running averages, in 32-bit format | 8 |
| **total** | **16** |

30.2 × 10⁹ weights × 16 bytes = 483.2 GB = 450.0 GiB

An 80 GB card holds 74.5 GiB and a 180 GB card holds 167.6 GiB, so the training state alone needs
more than six of the smaller cards or more than two of the larger ones.

**The detail.** The parameter count follows from the shape. Our 40 attention heads share 8 sets of
keys and values, called key-value heads. Eight key-value heads of 128 dimensions give keys and
values of width 1,024, which is one fifth of the query width.

2 × 5120² + 2 × 5120 × 1024 = 62.9M attention parameters per layer

The feed-forward network uses three matrices that connect the hidden size of 5,120 to an inner
size of 16,384.

3 × 5120 × 16384 = 251.7M feed-forward parameters per layer

(62.9 + 251.7)M × 96 layers = 30.2 × 10⁹

The embedding tables are left out of this count.

The forward pass also stores intermediate results, called activations, which the backward pass
needs. Korthikanti and colleagues published a count in 2022 of every tensor a transformer layer
keeps. With FlashAttention, which computes attention without storing the full table of attention
scores, the count comes to about **34 bytes per token per unit of hidden size**. The count was
made for a slightly different layer design, so 34 is an estimate for ours.

8192 tokens × 5120 × 34 bytes = 1.33 GiB per layer

Across 96 layers that is 127.5 GiB of activations for one sequence of 8,192 tokens.

> **Carry this forward:** the training state is 450.0 GiB, which is larger than either card, and
> the activations of one sequence are 127.5 GiB.

## 2. Terminology

Ten terms are used throughout the session, each with a number attached.

- A **GPU** is one accelerator card. This session uses two NVIDIA GPUs. The H100 holds 80 GB,
  which is 74.5 GiB. The B200, from the newer Blackwell generation, holds 180 GB, which is 167.6
  GiB.
- A **node** is one machine holding eight GPUs of the same kind.
- **NVLink** is the wiring that connects GPUs inside a node. H100 nodes use NVLink 4, which carries
  about 450 GB per second in each direction for each GPU. B200 nodes use NVLink 5, which carries
  about 900 GB per second in each direction for each GPU.
- **InfiniBand** is the network cable that connects nodes. Both kinds of node have one 400 Gb/s
  network card per GPU, and each card carries 400 ÷ 8 = 50 GB per second in each direction.
- A **micro-batch** is the group of sequences processed in one forward and backward pass. In this
  session a micro-batch is one sequence of 8,192 tokens.
- An **all-reduce** takes a tensor from every GPU and returns the combined result to every GPU.
  Arranged as a ring of N GPUs, each GPU sends a total of 2(N−1)/N times the size of the tensor,
  which is 1.75 times at N = 8.
- An **all-gather** collects one slice from each GPU and gives every GPU the complete tensor. A
  **reduce-scatter** combines the tensors and gives each GPU one slice of the result. A ring
  all-reduce is a reduce-scatter followed by an all-gather.
- An **all-to-all** has every GPU send a different piece to every other GPU.
- A **point-to-point send** moves a tensor from one GPU to one other GPU.
- A **degree** is the number of GPUs a form of parallelism divides its work across, written for
  example as TP = 8.

> **Carry this forward:** one NVLink 4 connection carries 9 times the traffic of one InfiniBand
> card, and one NVLink 5 connection carries 18 times.

## 3. Tensor Parallelism

A single weight matrix can be too large for one GPU. Tensor parallelism cuts that matrix into
slices and gives each GPU one slice. Every GPU multiplies its own slice at the same time, and the
GPUs combine their results before the next part of the layer begins.

The combining step is where the cost lies. It happens inside every layer, for every token, so the
GPUs exchange data constantly throughout the forward and backward passes.

**The detail.** The standard method was published as Megatron-LM in 2019, and it pairs two kinds
of split so that each block needs only one combining step.

The feed-forward network has three matrices. Two of them expand the hidden size from 5,120 to
16,384, and both are split by columns, so each GPU produces its own share of the 16,384 outputs
with no need to talk to the others. The third matrix brings the size back to 5,120 and is split by
rows, so each GPU consumes exactly the share the first two produced. The outputs of the row-split
matrix are then summed with one all-reduce.

Attention follows the same pattern. The query, key and value projections are split by attention
head, which is a column split. The output projection is split by rows and followed by one
all-reduce.

Each layer therefore performs two all-reduces in the forward pass and two in the backward pass.

| TP degree | training state per GPU |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 450.0 GiB |
| 2 | 225.0 GiB |
| 4 | 112.5 GiB |
| 8 | 56.25 GiB |

The traffic follows from the size of one activation tensor.

8192 tokens × 5120 × 2 bytes = 83.9 MB

At TP = 8, each of the four all-reduces moves 1.75 times that tensor, in every one of the 96
layers.

4 × 83.9 MB × 1.75 × 96 = 56.4 GB per sequence

| link | time to move 56.4 GB |
| --- | --- |
| NVLink 4, inside an H100 node | 0.125 s |
| NVLink 5, inside a B200 node | 0.063 s |
| InfiniBand, each GPU in a different node | 1.13 s |

That figure applies to each sequence. A data-parallel copy that processes 32 sequences in one step
moves 32 times as much, about 1,805 GB. Tensor parallelism is kept inside a single node because its
traffic grows with every token processed. Megatron-LM's authors measured this on servers with
eight network cards each, and their guidance is to use tensor parallelism up to the number of GPUs
in one server. PyTorch's asynchronous tensor parallelism reduces the waiting by running part of
this communication during the matrix multiplications. In torchtitan's measurements on 256 GPUs, it
raised throughput for Llama 3.1 70B by 12.59%.

> **Carry this forward:** tensor parallelism divides every layer's weights by the degree, and its
> traffic of 56.4 GB per sequence confines it to NVLink.

*Widget — Tensor parallelism.* One feed-forward block split across GPUs, with the first matrix
divided by columns and the second by rows. Raising the degree adds traffic per sequence, and the
link toggle shows how long that traffic takes on NVLink 4, NVLink 5 and InfiniBand.

## 4. Sequence Parallelism

Tensor parallelism splits the large matrices, and some small operations in each layer still run on
the full sequence on every GPU. Layer normalization, which rescales each token's values, is one of
them. Dropout, which sets random values to zero during training, is another. The activations those
operations store are therefore held in full on every GPU in the group.

Sequence parallelism splits those operations along the sequence. Each GPU keeps its share of the
tokens for them, which divides the stored activations by the tensor-parallel degree.

**The detail.** Megatron-LM added this in 2022. Each all-reduce is replaced by an all-gather before
the attention or feed-forward block and a reduce-scatter after it. A ring all-reduce is a
reduce-scatter followed by an all-gather, so the pair carries about the same volume as the
all-reduce it replaces.

| TP degree | training state | activations, one 8,192-token sequence | total per GPU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 225.0 GiB | 63.8 GiB | 288.8 GiB |
| 4 | 112.5 GiB | 31.9 GiB | 144.4 GiB |
| 8 | 56.25 GiB | 15.9 GiB | 72.2 GiB |

At TP = 8 the total is 72.2 GiB against an H100 card of 74.5 GiB. The remaining 2.3 GiB must also
hold communication buffers and the memory the framework reserves, which is too little in practice.
A B200 card of 167.6 GiB holds the same total with 95.4 GiB to spare. It also holds the TP = 4
total of 144.4 GiB, with 23.2 GiB to spare.

Section 9 shows how the optimizer's share of the state is reduced further.

The name "sequence parallelism" is also used elsewhere for splitting a long sequence across GPUs
for attention. This session calls that technique context parallelism and covers it in Section 7.

> **Carry this forward:** sequence parallelism divides the stored activations by the
> tensor-parallel degree at the same communication volume.

## 5. Pipeline Parallelism

A model can also be divided by layers. Pipeline parallelism places the first group of layers on one
GPU, the next group on the next GPU, and so on. Each GPU is called a stage. A sequence passes
forward through the stages like an item on an assembly line, and its gradients pass back through
them in reverse.

Each stage holds only its own layers, so the training state is divided by the number of stages.

**The detail.** With 96 layers the stages divide evenly at every power of two up to 32.

| PP degree | layers per stage | training state per GPU | activations of one sequence per stage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 24 | 112.5 GiB | 31.9 GiB |
| 8 | 12 | 56.25 GiB | 15.9 GiB |
| 16 | 6 | 28.1 GiB | 8.0 GiB |

A stage sends one activation tensor to the next stage for each micro-batch, and receives one
gradient tensor of the same size back.

8192 × 5120 × 2 bytes = 83.9 MB per micro-batch per boundary

InfiniBand moves 83.9 MB in 1.7 milliseconds. A step at PP = 8 with 32 micro-batches crosses 7
boundaries in each direction.

2 × 83.9 MB × 7 × 32 = 37.6 GB per step

That traffic travels between neighboring stages only. Pipeline parallelism can span nodes because
each send is small and goes to a single neighbor.

> **Carry this forward:** pipeline parallelism divides the model by layers, and its 83.9 MB sends
> are small enough to cross InfiniBand.

## 6. Pipeline Schedules

A pipeline has a waiting problem. When the first micro-batch enters stage 0, every later stage has
nothing to do until that micro-batch reaches it. The same happens in reverse at the end of the
step. The time a stage spends waiting is called the **bubble**.

The order in which stages process forward and backward passes is called the **schedule**, and it
decides how much memory each stage needs. Adding micro-batches shrinks the bubble.

**The detail.** Take p stages and m micro-batches. The first micro-batch needs p − 1 time slots to
reach the last stage, so every stage waits p − 1 slots and works m slots.

share of the step spent waiting = (p − 1) / (m + p − 1)

| stages \ micro-batches | 8 | 16 | 32 | 64 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 27.3% | 15.8% | 8.6% | 4.5% |
| 8 | 46.7% | 30.4% | 17.9% | 9.9% |
| 16 | 65.2% | 48.4% | 31.9% | 19.0% |

Published papers usually write the bubble as (p − 1)/m, which divides waiting time by working
time. At 8 stages and 32 micro-batches that form gives 21.9%, and the share of the step gives
17.9%. The two describe the same run.

Three schedules are in common use.

- **All forward, then all backward.** Every micro-batch completes its forward pass before any
  backward pass begins. Stage 0 must therefore hold the activations of all m micro-batches at once.
- **1F1B.** After a short warm-up, each stage alternates one forward pass with one backward pass.
  Stage 0 then holds at most p micro-batches at a time. The bubble is unchanged.
- **Interleaved 1F1B.** Each GPU holds v smaller chunks of layers from different parts of the
  model. The bubble shrinks to (p − 1)/(v·m + p − 1), and the number of sends grows v times.
  Stage 0 also holds more activations.

**Zero-bubble schedules.** A team at Sea AI split each backward pass into two parts, the gradient
for the layer's input and the gradient for its weights. The weight part can wait, so it fills slots
that would otherwise sit idle. Their ZB-H1 schedule cuts the bubble to a third of 1F1B's at the
same peak memory. Their ZB-H2 schedule removes the bubble, holds up to 2p − 1 micro-batches at
stage 0, and checks each optimizer step so that a bad step can be rolled back.

| schedule, 8 stages, 32 micro-batches | micro-batches held at stage 0 | activation memory at stage 0 | waiting share |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| all forward, then all backward | 32 | 510.0 GiB | 17.9% |
| 1F1B | 8 | 127.5 GiB | 17.9% |
| interleaved 1F1B, 2 chunks per GPU | more than 8 | above 127.5 GiB | 9.9% |

> **Carry this forward:** more micro-batches shrink the bubble, and 1F1B caps each stage's
> activations at the number of stages.

*Widget — Pipeline schedules.* A grid of stages against time slots, filled by the chosen schedule
and counted cell by cell. Switching the schedule changes the memory held at stage 0 and leaves the
waiting share unchanged.

## 7. Context Parallelism

Some training sequences are very long. A sequence of 131,072 tokens produces sixteen times the
activations of an 8,192-token sequence, which is far more than any GPU holds.

Context parallelism divides the tokens of one sequence across GPUs. Most of a layer processes each
token independently, so each GPU can handle its own share. Attention is the difficult part, because
each token must look at earlier tokens that live on other GPUs.

**The detail.** The activation figure from Section 1 scales directly with sequence length.

131072 × 5120 × 34 bytes × 96 layers = 2040 GiB

| CP degree | tokens per GPU | activations per GPU | with TP = 8 as well |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | 65,536 | 1,020.0 GiB | 127.5 GiB |
| 4 | 32,768 | 510.0 GiB | 63.8 GiB |
| 8 | 16,384 | 255.0 GiB | 31.9 GiB |
| 16 | 8,192 | 127.5 GiB | 15.9 GiB |

Three methods solve the attention problem.

**Ring Attention** connects the GPUs in a ring. Each GPU computes attention between its own queries
and the block of keys and values it currently holds, then passes that block to its neighbor. After
c − 1 passes every GPU has seen every block. At CP = 8 each block holds 16,384 tokens.

2 × 8 KV heads × 128 × 16384 × 2 bytes = 67.1 MB

Seven passes in each of 96 layers move 45.1 GB per sequence in the forward pass. A pass can run
while the receiving GPU computes attention on the block it already holds. That overlap hides the
pass only when computing attention on one block takes longer than sending the block.

**All-gather context parallelism** is the method Meta used for Llama 3's long sequences. Each GPU
keeps the queries for its own tokens. In every layer the GPUs run one all-gather of the keys and
values, so every GPU holds them for the whole sequence. Each GPU then computes attention between its
own queries and those full keys and values. The Llama 3 report gives two reasons for the choice. A
full set of keys and values makes any attention mask easy to apply, including the mask that keeps
packed documents apart. Keys and values are also small with 8 key-value heads, and attention work
grows with the square of the sequence length, so the all-gather takes a small share of the step. At
CP = 8 the all-gather moves the same 45.1 GB per sequence in the forward pass as the ring.

**Ulysses** uses an all-to-all to regroup the work. Before attention, each GPU holds some of the
tokens for every head. After the all-to-all, each GPU holds every token for some of the query heads.
Attention runs locally for those heads, and a second all-to-all restores the original split. The
Ulysses degree must divide the number of query heads. Our 40 query heads allow degrees of 2, 4, 5,
8, 10, 20 and 40, and a degree of 16 is impossible. When the degree exceeds our 8 key-value heads,
the key-value heads are copied so that every GPU holds at least one.

Causal attention makes the work uneven when each GPU holds one continuous piece of the sequence. A
token attends only to earlier tokens, so the GPU holding the first piece has the least attention
work and the GPU holding the last piece has the most. At CP = 8 the last GPU does 15 times the
attention work of the first. **Head-tail load balancing** cuts the sequence into 2c chunks and gives
each GPU one early chunk and one late chunk, which evens the work across GPUs. Llama 3 trained with
this split.

The methods suit different links. Ulysses sends all-to-all traffic, which runs well inside one
NVLink domain. Ring passes go only to a neighbor, which suits the slower links between nodes. A
hybrid runs Ulysses inside each node and a ring across nodes.

ring, as an all-gather, and as a regroup by query head. The load panel compares one continuous
piece per GPU with the head-tail split.

## 8. Communication Overhead

Every form of parallelism adds traffic. The forms differ in volume and in the pattern of sending,
and the pattern decides which wires can carry the traffic.

**The detail.** One copy of our parameters in 16-bit format is 30.2 × 10⁹ × 2 = 60.4 GB. Data
parallelism all-reduces the gradients once per step.

60.4 GB × 1.75 = 105.7 GB per step, at 8 data-parallel copies

| form | pattern | volume | grows with |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data parallelism, 8 copies | all-reduce of gradients | 105.7 GB per step | parameter count |
| tensor parallelism, TP = 8 | four all-reduces of activations per layer | 56.4 GB per sequence | tokens |
| pipeline parallelism | point-to-point send between neighbors | 83.9 MB per micro-batch per boundary | tokens |
| context parallelism, ring, CP = 8, 131,072 tokens | point-to-point pass of key-value blocks | 45.1 GB per sequence, forward | tokens |

| form | through one NVLink 4 connection | through one NVLink 5 connection | through one InfiniBand card |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data parallelism, per step | 0.235 s | 0.117 s | 2.11 s |
| tensor parallelism, per sequence | 0.125 s | 0.063 s | 1.13 s |
| pipeline parallelism, per send | 0.19 ms | 0.093 ms | 1.7 ms |
| context parallelism, forward pass per sequence | 0.100 s | 0.050 s | 0.90 s |

Those times assume all of the traffic crosses one link. NCCL, the library that runs these
collectives, spreads traffic between nodes across all eight network cards in a node and chooses
among several algorithms, so real times between nodes are shorter.

All four can overlap with computation to some degree. Data-parallel gradients are sent during the
backward pass as each layer finishes. Pipeline sends happen between stages. Ring passes can run
during attention on the current block. In the backward pass, the tensor-parallel all-reduce runs
while the GPU computes the weight gradients. In the forward pass, asynchronous tensor parallelism
splits the communication into pieces that run alongside the matrix multiplications. The
context-parallel figures cover the forward pass, and the backward pass sends key-value gradients as
well.

> which is why it needs the fastest link.

## 9. Topology-Aware Placement

A cluster has fast wiring inside each node and slower cables between nodes. Topology-aware
placement assigns each form of parallelism to a link fast enough to carry its traffic.

The forms are nested from the most demanding to the least. Tensor parallelism is innermost,
followed by context parallelism, then pipeline parallelism, then data parallelism on the outside.

**The detail.** Take 64 GPUs in 8 nodes. Tensor parallelism at degree 8 fills each node over
NVLink. Data parallelism at degree 8 spans the nodes over InfiniBand.

| per GPU | GiB |
| --- | --- |
| training state at TP = 8 | 56.25 |
| activations at TP = 8 with sequence parallelism | 15.9 |
| total | 72.2 |

That total leaves too little headroom on an H100 card of 74.5 GiB. The 12 bytes per weight for the
master copy and the two running averages can also be divided across the 8 data-parallel copies,
because each copy needs only its own share to perform the update. The training state then falls to
19.3 GiB.

19.3 + 15.9 = 35.3 GiB per GPU

Megatron-LM's guidance is to use tensor parallelism up to the number of GPUs in one server, and to
add pipeline parallelism across servers. Our model's 8 key-value heads also keep tensor parallelism
at 8 or below, because a larger degree would need copies of those heads.

Most clusters connect their nodes with a **rail-optimized network**. Each node has one network card
per GPU. Network card 0 of every node connects to one switch, network card 1 of every node connects
to the next switch, and so on. Each of those paths is called a rail. Pipeline and data-parallel
partners usually sit at the same position in different nodes, so their traffic stays on a single
rail.

A B200 node has the same eight GPUs and eight network cards, so the same placement applies. Its
NVLink 5 connection carries 18 times the traffic of one network card, which is twice the ratio
inside an H100 node. Its larger cards also allow tensor parallelism at degree 4, because the
Section 4 total at TP = 4 is 144.4 GiB. Section 11 describes a run on hardware where NVLink was only
about three times faster than InfiniBand, and what that ratio did to its layout.

> **Carry this forward:** tensor parallelism stays on NVLink inside each node, and a
> rail-optimized network carries the traffic between nodes.

*Widget — Topology-aware placement.* 64 GPUs in 8 nodes, with GPU k of every node wired to rail
switch k. The node toggle switches between H100 nodes on NVLink 4 and B200 nodes on NVLink 5. The
tensor-parallel view draws each group as an outline, and a degree of 16 makes a group cross the
network. The data-parallel view lights the partners of GPU 0 and the rails their traffic uses.

## 10. Production Layouts

Large runs combine every form of parallelism at once. Meta published the layout used to train Llama
3 405B, which shows the nesting from Section 9 at a scale of sixteen thousand GPUs.

MFU, or model FLOPs utilization, is the fraction of the GPUs' arithmetic capacity that the run
actually used.

**The detail.** The run used up to 16,384 H100 GPUs connected by RoCE, an Ethernet network at 400
Gb/s.

| GPUs | TP | CP | PP | DP | sequence length | MFU |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8,192 | 8 | 1 | 16 | 64 | 8,192 | 43% |
| 16,384 | 8 | 1 | 16 | 128 | 8,192 | 41% |
| 16,384 | 8 | 16 | 16 | 8 | 131,072 | 38% |

Each row multiplies to its GPU count, and the last row is 8 × 16 × 16 × 8 = 16384.

The dimensions nest as tensor, context, pipeline, then data parallelism, with tensor parallelism
kept inside one server.

The two rows at 16,384 GPUs compare the two sequence lengths. The 131,072-token configuration, with
16-way context parallelism, ran at 38% MFU against 41%. Data parallelism also fell from 128 to 8
between those rows. The long-sequence row used all-gather context parallelism, with each sequence
cut into 32 chunks for its 16 context-parallel GPUs.

> **Carry this forward:** a production run nests tensor, context, pipeline and data parallelism in
> that order, and long-context training costs a few points of utilization.

## 11. DeepSeek-V3 (SELF STUDY)

DeepSeek-V3 is a mixture-of-experts model. Each layer contains many small feed-forward networks
called experts, and each token uses only a few of them. Spreading the experts across GPUs is called
expert parallelism.

V3 is notable for one layout decision. It trained without tensor parallelism, and the reason is its
hardware.

**The detail.** V3 has 671B parameters, of which 37B are active for each token. It trained on 2,048
H800 GPUs with 8 in each node. Its report gives NVLink at about 160 GB per second and InfiniBand at
50, a ratio of about 3.2.

| dimension | degree |
| --- | --- |
| pipeline parallelism | 16 |
| expert parallelism | 64, across 8 nodes |
| data parallelism | with optimizer state divided across copies |
| tensor parallelism | none |

The report describes tensor parallelism as costly and states that memory optimizations made it
unnecessary. DeepSeek's companion paper on hardware links the decision to the H800's reduced NVLink
bandwidth.

**Node-limited routing** caps each token at 4 nodes. InfiniBand carries the token to the GPU at the
same position inside each of those nodes, and NVLink carries it on to the experts inside that node.
A token reaches an average of 3.2 experts per node, so this arrangement supports up to 13 experts
per token at the communication cost of the 8 that V3 uses.

**DualPipe** is V3's pipeline schedule. Micro-batches enter the pipeline from both ends at once, and
expert and pipeline communication runs while the GPU computes. DualPipe keeps two copies of the
model's parameters so that every GPU can run its part of the model for both directions. It splits
each backward pass into two parts: the gradient for the layer's input, which the previous stage
needs soon, and the gradient for the layer's weights, which can wait.

| schedule | bubble | parameters per device | activations per device |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1F1B | (PP − 1)(F + B) | 1× | PP |
| ZB1P, a zero-bubble 1F1B | (PP − 1)(F + B − 2W) | 1× | PP |
| DualPipe | (PP/2 − 1)(F&B + B − 3W) | 2× | PP + 1 |

Here F is forward time, B is backward time, W is the time for the weight-gradient part, and F&B is
the time when a forward and backward pass overlap. A variant called DualPipeV gives the same bubble
on half the devices.

V3 computed the forward and both backward matrix multiplications of its linear layers in 8-bit
floating point. The embedding, output head, the gating that picks each token's experts,
normalization and attention stayed at higher precision. Activations were scaled in tiles of 1 by
128 values and weights in blocks of 128 by 128. Training took 2664K + 119K + 5K = 2788K H800 GPU
hours.

Kimi K2, a model of over one trillion parameters, used 16-way pipeline parallelism with interleaved
1F1B, 16-way expert parallelism, and data parallelism with optimizer state divided across copies.
Its report states that DualPipe was rejected because it doubles the memory for parameters and
gradients.

> **Carry this forward:** when NVLink is only about three times faster than InfiniBand, a large run
> can drop tensor parallelism and rely on pipeline and expert parallelism with communication
> overlapped onto computation.

*Widget — DualPipe.* One pipeline fed from one end beside one fed from both ends. In the second
pipeline, each GPU holds two stages, one for each direction. Step through the slots and count how
long each pipeline takes to give every GPU work.

## 12. DeepSeek-V4 (SELF STUDY)

DeepSeek-V4 comes in two sizes, Pro and Flash. Its report describes several parallelism problems
created by the model's design, together with the solution to each. The report gives no cluster
size, GPU type, GPU hours or parallelism degrees.

**The detail.**

| | V4-Pro | V4-Flash |
| --- | --- | --- |
| total parameters | 1.6T | 284B |
| active per token | 49B | 13B |
| layers | 61 | 43 |
| hidden size | 7,168 | 4,096 |
| training tokens | 33T | 32T |

V4 removed V3's limit on how many nodes a token can reach, and the report states that the
parallelism strategy was redesigned to match. The accompanying communication kernel runs expert
traffic during computation, and DeepSeek measured it at 1.50 to 1.73 times faster for general
inference and up to 1.96 times for latency-sensitive work. Those figures come from inference and
reinforcement-learning rollout.

**A hybrid division of optimizer state for Muon.** Muon is an optimizer that computes each update
from a whole weight matrix. Dividing a matrix into pieces across GPUs, which is how optimizer state
is usually divided, would break that requirement. V4 assigns each dense matrix whole to one GPU,
using a balancing algorithm so that every GPU receives a similar load, and it caps the size of each
group. The report puts the extra memory needed to even out the groups at under 10%. Expert weights
are flattened and divided evenly across every GPU, since each expert is updated on its own.
Gradients are rounded to 16-bit format and summed locally in 32-bit format after an all-to-all.

**Two-stage context parallelism.** V4 uses compressed sparse attention, in which each token attends
to a selected set of compressed blocks of keys and values. It groups keys and values into blocks of
m consecutive entries, and each compressed entry reads its own block together with the m entries
just before it. Dividing a sequence across GPUs, with s entries on each GPU, creates two problems.

The first problem is uneven length. Each training sample is packed from several sequences, each
sequence is compressed on its own, and any final group shorter than m is dropped. The compressed
length on each GPU is therefore usually below s/m, and it differs from one GPU to the next.

The second problem is the boundary. The entries that a compression step needs can straddle the
boundary between two neighboring GPUs.

1. **Stage one.** Each GPU sends its last m uncompressed entries to the next GPU. The receiving GPU
   compresses them together with its own s entries and pads its output to a fixed length of
   s/m + 1 compressed entries.
2. **Stage two.** An all-gather collects the compressed entries from every GPU, and a fused
   operation arranges them into the full set of cp × s/m entries with the padding at the end.

The same two stages serve V4's other attention layers, which compress more heavily.

V4 also widens its residual stream, the vector that carries each token from one layer to the next,
into four parallel copies, a design called manifold-constrained hyper-connections. That widening
adds pipeline traffic. Fused kernels, selective recomputation and an adjusted overlapped 1F1B
schedule together hold the extra cost to 6.7% of a stage's time.

> **Carry this forward:** V4 shows that architecture choices create parallelism problems, including
> an optimizer that needs whole matrices and a compression that needs whole blocks.

*Widget — Two-stage context parallelism.* Four GPUs holding key-value entries, with compression
blocks drawn over them at small illustrative sizes. Stage one hands the boundary entries across,
and stage two gathers the compressed entries into one ordered set.

## 13. DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash (SELF STUDY)

DeepSeek released V4.1-Flash on 10 September 2026. Its upper 20 layers compute their keys and
values from the output of a single lower layer, and many of its attention layers share keys, values
and index results with later layers. Both designs save a large amount of memory when the model is
serving requests.

Sharing between layers creates a problem during training. A pipeline cut can place the layer that
produces the shared state on one stage and the layers that read it on another stage.

**The detail.** V4.1-Flash has 552B parameters in its main network and a further 196B in lookup
tables. It activates 8B parameters per token while reading a prompt and 16B while generating. Its
published configuration lists 40 layers, a hidden size of 5,120, and 384 routed experts plus one
shared expert, with 6 routed experts active per token.

The design is called a causal encoder-decoder and is derived from an earlier design called YoCo.
Every layer is causal, so each token attends only to earlier tokens. The upper 20 layers project
their keys and values from the output of layer 20, each with its own projection weights.

The report describes three measures that make this train across pipeline stages.

- **Shadow indexers.** The indexer is the small module that picks which compressed blocks each
  token attends to. Each stage that needs the shared attention components keeps a lightweight
  executable copy, and one stage owns the parameters.
- **Shared state on the existing sends.** The shared tensors travel on the point-to-point path
  between stages, divided in the same way as the context-parallel split.
- **Lifetime tracking per micro-batch.** Each shared tensor stays in memory until its last reader
  finishes, across the forward pass, recomputation and the backward pass.

The lookup tables are called Engram. They are tables looked up by short sequences of up to four
tokens long, divided into two modules. Their tables and projections are stored in 8-bit floating
point. The two modules sit at layers 1 and 14, counting from zero, and the report states that this
placement balances memory across the training pipeline stages.

V4.1-Flash trained on 45T tokens with the batch held at 100.6 million tokens. Its sparse attention
trained from the start at 64K tokens, and the sequence length was extended to one million at 34T
tokens. The report gives no cluster size, GPU hours or parallelism degrees.

> **Carry this forward:** sharing state between layers turns a pipeline cut into a question of
> which stage owns each tensor and how long each tensor must stay in memory.

layer 20 feeding the keys and values of layers 21 to 40. The stage control redraws the cuts and

## 14. Choosing a Layout

Every form covered so far divides something. A run picks one degree for each of them, and the
degrees multiply to the number of GPUs.

GPUs = TP × CP × PP × DP

The degrees are chosen in a fixed order, because the memory that one form saves decides whether the
next form is needed at all.

**The detail.** The order below runs from the cheapest decision to the most expensive.

1. **Count the two numbers.** For our model that is a training state of 450.0 GiB and 127.5 GiB of
   activations for one sequence of 8,192 tokens.
2. **Set tensor parallelism to the number of GPUs in one node.** That is 8, and our 8 key-value
   heads cap it at 8 as well. Sequence parallelism runs at the same degree. A GPU now holds 56.25
   GiB of state and 15.9 GiB of activations, which is the 72.2 GiB from Section 4.
3. **Divide the optimizer state across the data-parallel copies.** The 12 bytes per weight for the
   master copy and the two running averages are needed on one GPU only during the update. At 8
   copies the state falls to 19.3 GiB, and a GPU holds 35.3 GiB. This step adds no communication,
   so it is always taken when there is more than one copy.
4. **Add context parallelism when one sequence stops fitting.** The activations grow with the
   sequence length, and at 131,072 tokens they reach 2,040 GiB for one sequence. Context
   parallelism is the only form that divides a single sample.
5. **Add pipeline parallelism when the state still does not fit.** Pipeline stages divide the state
   by the number of stages. Our model at 35.3 GiB per GPU does not need them, and a 400B model on
   the same hardware would.
6. **Give the remaining GPUs to data parallelism.** With 64 GPUs and tensor parallelism at 8, that
   leaves 8 copies.
7. **Check the global batch.** The global batch is the data-parallel degree multiplied by the
   micro-batch and the number of accumulation steps. The token budget for the run fixes the global
   batch, so a large data-parallel degree forces a small micro-batch.
8. **Check the bubble if there is a pipeline.** The waiting share from Section 6 is
   (p − 1)/(m + p − 1), so 8 stages need about 32 micro-batches to hold it near 18%.
9. **Measure the step time.** The arithmetic produces candidate layouts, and the measured
   throughput chooses between them. Section 10 gives two layouts on the same hardware that reached
   43% and 38% of the GPUs' arithmetic capacity.

Take one node of 8 B200 GPUs, where each card holds 167.6 GiB. Tensor parallelism is 8, so there
are no data-parallel copies, and steps 3 and 6 return nothing. Context parallelism would have to
share the same 8 GPUs with tensor parallelism, which raises the state per GPU by as much as it
lowers the activations, so step 4 returns nothing as well. The sequence length alone decides.

| sequence length | activations per GPU | state per GPU | total | fits 167.6 GiB |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8,192 | 15.9 GiB | 56.25 GiB | 72.2 GiB | yes |
| 16,384 | 31.9 GiB | 56.25 GiB | 88.1 GiB | yes |
| 32,768 | 63.8 GiB | 56.25 GiB | 120.0 GiB | yes |
| 65,536 | 127.5 GiB | 56.25 GiB | 183.8 GiB | no |
| 131,072 | 255.0 GiB | 56.25 GiB | 311.3 GiB | no |

One node trains our model up to 32,768 tokens. Longer sequences need more nodes, which is what
makes steps 3, 4 and 6 useful. Two nodes hold a 65,536-token sequence at 162.7 GiB per GPU. A
131,072-token sequence needs 4 nodes with context parallelism at 2, which puts 162.7 GiB on each
GPU.

> first and data parallelism last, and the measured step time settles what is left.

*Widget — Choosing a layout.* One 30.2B model on nodes of eight B200 GPUs. Pick a sequence length
and a node count to see the degrees the rules produce, the memory on each card, and which forms are
switched on.

## 15. V5 Decisions

Three things are settled by this session. The model uses 96 layers, so pipeline stages divide it
evenly. Tensor parallelism stays inside a node, because it communicates inside every layer and
Megatron-LM's measurements found it best kept within one server. Sequence parallelism always
accompanies tensor parallelism, because the activation budget in Section 4 depends on it.

Four questions remain open.

| Question | What would settle it |
| --- | --- |
| TP 8 with data parallelism across nodes, or a pipeline added as well? | A measured step time for both on our cluster, with activations and communication buffers included. |
| Which context parallelism for the long-context stage? | The target sequence length, the attention masks the data needs, and the Ulysses degrees available once TP = 8 leaves 5 query heads on each GPU. |
| Which pipeline schedule, if a pipeline is used? | The activation memory of 1F1B against the smaller bubble of the interleaved schedule, measured at our micro-batch count. |
| TP 4 or TP 8 on B200 nodes? | A measured step time for both, since the TP = 4 total of 144.4 GiB fits a B200 card of 167.6 GiB. |

## 16. Reversibility

*(This section and §17 are the basis of the assignment.)*

Every section so far has divided the activations across more GPUs. A reversible network removes
most of them instead. The forward pass keeps the state that enters the stack and the state that
leaves it, and the backward pass rebuilds every layer's activations as it needs them, by running
the layer's update in reverse.

The memory this saves does not depend on the number of layers. A 96-layer model and a 20-layer
model store the same two boundary states.

**The detail.** The method used here was published in November 2025 by Gal, Eliasof, Turek,
Ascher, Treister and Haber, as *Reversing Large Language Models for Efficient Training and
Fine-Tuning* (arXiv 2512.02056, submitted 2025-11-27, verified against the arXiv API 2026-09-24).
It treats the layer index as a step in time and advances the residual stream with a rule that can
be run in both directions. Write p_ℓ for the residual stream entering layer ℓ, and f_θℓ for the
whole transformer block, attention followed by the feed-forward network. The **midpoint rule** is

p_{ℓ+1} = p_{ℓ−1} + 2h · f_θℓ(p_ℓ)

where h is a fixed step size. Reading that line from right to left recovers the state two layers
back.

p_{ℓ−1} = p_{ℓ+1} − 2h · f_θℓ(p_ℓ)

The backward pass therefore walks down the stack, and at every step it reconstructs the input it
needs from the output it already holds. Nothing in between has to be kept.

An ordinary block adds its output to its own input, as p_ℓ = p_{ℓ−1} + f_θℓ(p_{ℓ−1}). That rule
cannot be reversed, because recovering p_{ℓ−1} would need f_θℓ(p_{ℓ−1}), which is computed from the
state being recovered. The reversible rule adds the block's output to the state two layers back,
and it evaluates the block at the state in between, which is the state the backward pass already
holds.

This is not the same as recomputation, which Section 1 counted at 34 bytes per token per unit of
hidden size. Recomputation stores the input of every group of layers and runs those layers forward
again during the backward pass. A reversible stack stores no layer inputs at all, and it rebuilds
them by running the rule backward.

The cost is compute. Each layer's block runs once in the forward pass and once more during the
backward pass. The authors estimate the overhead at 30% to 50% of a step, on the reasoning that a
backward pass already costs more than a forward pass, so one extra forward evaluation is a small
addition. They measured throughput at a hidden size of 512 with 8 attention heads, and at 96 layers
the reversible model reached 114.49 samples per second against 56.96 for the standard model. That
gain comes from the batch size the saved memory allows, which was 874 against 52.

Two constraints come with the method.

- **The forward pass must be deterministic.** The backward pass reconstructs the activations by
  computing the same block again, and a random dropout mask would make the reconstruction differ
  from what the forward pass used. The Lightning LM report treats dropout of zero as a correctness
  requirement for this reason.
- **The rule is only marginally stable.** The paper's analysis requires the step size and the blend
  coefficient to sit in a narrow range, and it reports that reversible networks can be difficult to
  train outside it.

The paper's own memory result is a batch-size measurement. On an 80 GB H100 its standard model
fitted a batch of 26 and its reversible model fitted 257, which is a factor of 9.88, and the same
ratio of about 10 held on five different cards.

> during the backward pass, which makes activation memory independent of depth at the cost of
> about a third more compute per step.

### Addendum: the variants as the paper defines them (from the PDF, not the lesson)

The lesson states only the plain midpoint rule. The assignment asks for "mid-point, euler, etc".
These are the paper's exact definitions (arXiv 2512.02056v2), for use when implementing:

| variant | update | inverse | paper eq. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Midpoint | p_{ℓ+1} = p_{ℓ−1} + 2h·f(p_ℓ) | p_{ℓ−1} = p_{ℓ+1} − 2h·f(p_ℓ) | (2.4) |
| Midpoint (a), with blend coefficient a | p_{ℓ+1} = a·p_{ℓ−1} + (1−a)·p_ℓ + h·f(p_ℓ) | p_{ℓ−1} = (p_{ℓ+1} − (1−a)p_ℓ − h·f(p_ℓ)) / a | (3.6) |
| Leapfrog (second-order, wave equation) | p_{ℓ+1} = 2p_ℓ − p_{ℓ−1} + h²·f(p_ℓ) | p_{ℓ−1} = 2p_ℓ − p_{ℓ+1} + h²·f(p_ℓ) | (2.6) |
| Hamiltonian (symplectic Euler, two streams) | q_ℓ = a·q_{ℓ−1} + Attn(LN₁(p_{ℓ−1})); p_ℓ = b·p_{ℓ−1} + MLP(LN₂(q_ℓ)), a = b = 1 | invert MLP step then Attn step | (2.8)–(2.9) |

Here f(p) = Attn(LN₁(p)) + MLP(LN₂(p + Attn(LN₁(p)))), the whole pre-LN block (eq. 2.5). Notes
from the paper:

- Its main from-scratch experiments (GPT-2 Small/Large on OpenWebText, nanoGPT hyperparameters,
  8× L40S) use **Midpoint (a)** and **Leapfrog**. Plain midpoint appears in an ablation (Table 6).
- Stability (§3): with a constant-coefficient analysis, forward-and-backward stability needs
  |a| = 1 and |b + λh| ≤ 2. Plain midpoint is sensitive to real positive Jacobian eigenvalues,
  which is why leapfrog is offered. The Hamiltonian form needs a·b = 1.
- The paper says Midpoint (a) "behaves in expectation just like the forward **Euler** equation in
  terms of stability" (§3.2), and the Hamiltonian scheme is described as "resembling the
  **symplectic Euler** integrator". So the transcript's "Euler" most plausibly means one of these
  two. This has to be decided and stated in the write-up.
- Table 3 (max batch, baseline → midpoint): RTX6000 24GB 6 → 58; A10 24GB 6 → 58; A100 40GB
  12 → 119; A6000 48GB 15 → 140; H100 80GB 26 → 257 (≈ 9.3–9.9×).
- Table 4 (d = 512, 8 heads): batch 326/176/88/52 → 1550/1374/1076/874 at L = 16/32/64/96, and
  throughput gain 20.7% / 24.1% / 48.8% / 101.0%.
- Lightning LM (§17 below) ran h = 0.25 and blend coefficient a = 0.5, and warns that library
  defaults differ.

## 17. What Reversibility Changes

Reversibility does not make memory free. It moves the constraint. The activations stop being the
term that decides the layout, and the weights and the optimizer state become that term instead.
Those are the things ZeRO divides, so the decisions in Section 14 change order.

**The detail.** Apply the rule to our own model. A reversible stack stores the state that enters
the stack and the state that leaves it, which is 2 × tokens × 5120 × 2 bytes, and it needs the
working memory of the one layer it is currently rebuilding, which is the 1.33 GiB per layer from
Section 1.

| sequence | stored activations | reversible activations |
| --- | --- | --- |

The 96 in the calculation disappears, and what remains grows only with the number of tokens.

Take the single node from Section 14, eight B200 GPUs with tensor parallelism at 8. The state per
GPU is 56.25 GiB in both columns.

| sequence | stored, total per GPU | reversible, total per GPU |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8,192 | 72.2 GiB | 56.4 GiB |
| 32,768 | 120.0 GiB | 57.0 GiB |
| 131,072 | 311.3 GiB | 59.2 GiB |

One node stops at 32,768 tokens when the activations are stored. The same node holds 131,072
tokens when they are rebuilt, and the card still has 108 GiB free.

Each form of parallelism is affected differently.

- **Tensor parallelism is unchanged.** It divides the weight matrices, and the weights are still
  there.
- **Sequence parallelism now divides the boundary states**, which are small. Its original job was
  the stored activations.
- **Pipeline parallelism loses one of its two reasons.** It divided the state by layer and it
  divided the activations by layer, and the second reason is gone.
- **Context parallelism is needed at much longer sequences.** The length at which one sequence
  stops fitting moves out by about two orders of magnitude.
- **The ZeRO stages become more important.** They divide the weights, the gradients and the
  optimizer state, which is what now fills the card.

One interaction needs care. Under ZeRO-3 a GPU holds only a slice of each layer's weights, and the
backward pass gathers them once to compute the gradients. A reversible backward pass reads those
weights a second time, when it rebuilds the activations, so the gathering has to happen there as
well. The Lightning LM report states the principle directly: the recompute path is a second forward
pass, and every parameter that the forward pass gathers has to be gathered again for it.

**Lightning LM** is the evidence that this works at scale. It trained a 120B sparse
mixture-of-experts model with 20 layers, a hidden size of 4,096 and a sequence length of 8,192, on
a single node of eight GPUs, with a measured peak of about 256 GB per GPU. Its report gives 130.9
GB per GPU for the 9B model at a sequence length of 8,192, and estimates the same run at 550 to 650
GB per GPU with stored activations. On eight 40 GB A100s, its 2B model at 4,096 tokens trained with
a batch of 32 under reversibility, and a batch above 8 did not fit without it. Its integrator ran
with a **step size of 0.25 and a blend coefficient of 0.5**, and the report states that these
values have to be set explicitly because the library defaults differ.

Two limits are worth stating plainly. The comparison numbers above 40 GB are estimates of what
stored activations would have cost, because those runs were never made. Reversibility also slows a
run down whenever memory is not the binding constraint, and the Lightning LM report gives its own
2B model on 80 GB cards as the case where the standard path was faster.

> **Carry this forward:** reversibility trades compute for memory that does not grow with depth,
> which moves the binding term from activations to the training state and changes which form of
> parallelism is needed first.

## 18. Assignment

Train a 20M LLM for 50M tokens on Google Colab (or anything else of your choice). Fix Batch size
that you can run. Train again with Reversibility (report which variant worked for you, mid-point,
euler, etc) Train again with Reversibility, but push it to the maximum batch size.

Report final loss, speed (token/s), memory peak and other findings.
