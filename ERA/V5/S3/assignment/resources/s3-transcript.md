The Admin: attention mechanism or some weird architecture or maybe some more internal connections in the model architecture is going to change how the model is and we'll get a state of the art but what has happened in last literally since 2018 so we can say 16 actually it's close to 10 years now the architectures have sort of become consistent nearly all labs have very similar architecture very small changes based on whether they invented
The Admin: or they need to add something else or some new research has come in which says that if you do this there's slightly more changes but after that they realize that the most important thing is this which is the data collection and sourcing if your data is good then the model can learn right and AI is very different from the earlier convolutional networks we had or image detection things that even there also you can correlate your model as good as the data it is trained on.
The Admin: Another way of understanding this is your model if your model is trained on a kind of data then it can work on it right or work on that kind of problem which means that your model is data right that line has a lot of load bearing as we understood the meaning of this term in the last session also but this is the most important thing this is the 90% of everything data collection of course after that we have to clean it and other things also so we'll talk about that part and you're
also going to see the importance of the session two. There are some widgets here which will allow you to see how it changes the whole training mechanism. How long we have to train just based on tokenizer you have a good tokenizer you can train fast right that is also linked here. So the way this session is divided is first of all we're going to talk a bit about what we did in EVA4 and the reason era v4 and the reason for that is a lot of learning has come from there.
The Admin: we've done some mistakes also we've done some interesting I'll say changes or interesting way of looking at data so that also gives us a good idea right so the first two sessions first one literally give you an idea of what is involved inside in the second session we did slightly more in the attention part of it we're going to continue that journey the second session wasn't tokenizer we cannot send a text right we cannot send a word to the it has So, be converted into some sort of
numbers. So journey is that we have words we convert that into a to token has an ID that ID gets converted into some embedding that embedding is something that is learned. we have a way where we can avoid the learning of this part also but let's stick to the traditional architecture. So word converts into a token depending on how tokenizer is and after that it converts into a number in the list.
The Admin: For example, it is 4,698. That converts into either 4,96 or 2048 or 1024 dimensional vector depending on how big the model architecture is or how many parameters we have in the model. Right? So that's the only way we can send our data into the LN. Now as I shared today nearly all architectures are Not very slight difference. it's like Coke and Pepsi there's a and thumbs up also. So that's the thing that is different. Color is same. They all need to be served at u cold
temperatures. One is slightly more tingy the other is slightly more harsher and based on your preferences you'll pick one or the other. Right? So data is the model. If we understand that whatever the model sees, what it learns and what capabilities emerge everything goes back to data.
The Admin: So if do you do not have data on a particular topic your model is not going to ever be a good model on that particular stuff right now in era v4 we collected 1.15 trillion tokens this was collected through different sources we'll talk about those sources that are here we trained 120 billion model this was a seated architecture which meant that first we trained a 2 billion we used a 2 billion to train our 5 billion we used the five billion to train
The Admin: a 9 billion and we then use a 9 billion to train a 120 billion right it was scaled up it grew just like a tree we're going to talk about how do we do that what are the benefits of it it's somewhere saves around 10 times the learning so that's a really really good architecture to look at we ran it for 67 days on 8GPU single node and that's where some of the optimization came in and have you not used spot instances and some of the just spot instances have
The Admin: we would have spent around (00,000 on training we not used our own architecture of optimization on the GPUs and train other company then this would be close to a million dollar training just on 120B 1.15 right so we did a lot of optimization to get to these numbers and we're going to see how can we improve further on this and a part of this goes to the data and a tokenizer and today you're going to see that if you can get a data and a tokenizer right then you're half already
there right after that is getting the pipeline in which we already have the corpus was built by students. They did a lot of mistake early on. there was no and that is what happens when there are 200 people working
00:05:00
The Admin: and they do not know in the session three what data collection is and they learn about the data collection and tokenization and data cleanup in the capstone right so then we have 7 days to compress everything and then work of course number six will happen and that's what happened also but just to give you an idea these numbers might look big but look at 4 llama 4 has been trained on 30 trillion tokens right that's a massive difference compared to what we could do and what we
could do right 3 is 36 trillion tokens across 119 languages. We could focus probably on 20 languages So reaching a scale requires more than just computer. It's not that you just give computer and a model can train on it. You need a You need tokenizer to be able to take care of these 119 languages. Otherwise, you're throwing a lot of tokens but not a lot of words. I think this should make sense, right? You're throwing a lot of tokens to the model, but it doesn't have a lot of words.
Should be very clear.
The Admin: For example, SE server model will send around 76 tokens for 13 UA words, right? So the big difference in compared to when we say it is trained on 130 trillion tokens versus by the way how many words were there? That's a question we should ask. And this question should have meaning today because you have gone through the session too. So we're going to cover five questions here. What data set look like at each training stage? We do not have one training stage. We have sometimes five
training stages also and the data changes in all of these stages.
The Admin: It's called data only but what is it and how is it stored and how is it processed and how is it sent to the model and how the loss is calculated is different in all these stages right so we need to be aware of that second is how much data is required how do we calculate how much data do we need now there's a very simple answer for this there's one word answer for this and I think all of that answer how much data we need what is the answer for that money.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: More the water.
nagapavankumar kalepu: Money.
The Admin: It's money.
sonu agarwal: Also like hardware capacity.
The Admin: How much money do you have? So that really transforms into how much data we need. But then you're going to ask that how is money directly linked because let's say I have 1 million just for discussion. How do I know how many tokens that results into? And that's where there are a few papers that comes in. these papers are called scaling laws.
The Admin: Scaling law basically means that if you increase the available computation for a model, these are the ideal number of tokens you should train on. Right? So we already have such equations. So you can plug all of them and you can go on sheet the Microsoft Excel sheet. You can plug those numbers there. You can ask RGB also today and it can tell you that if you have 1 million then you're targeting this kind of model then this is the amount of data set that is required. There are
exceptions to it. We're going to see what those exceptions actually are for and how can we play around that.
The Admin: This is the most important question which is after every question is important and I will say this is the most important question for all five of them but just look at what question this is what data creates which capability that's brilliant and that is something that I think all of you have gone through if you've gone through any competitive exam you're training for J CAT or gate or so we have CAT we have gate some door maybe window maybe some desk or lead
The Admin: code you have all of these tests right what book should you read UPSC for example the massive amount of books that need to be ingested if I will talk about J so there we had irido as the bible if you can solve two question that you can solve j then you have a sharma I don't know if you guys remember those books then we have morrison void for chemistry these are some of the classics if you can understand these books then you can actually attempt the paper so here again the question
goes back at what data
The Admin: creates which capability and that is very important because if you want to be good at chemistry then you need to be able to read essence I don't know how many of essence it's a I think 100page book and I love that book organic chem blew my mind you could see the molecules in that book that book has no image by the very few images but the way it explains is that you can look at a molecule for example if you imagine CH3 minus or CH5 plus right that's also not possible. let's a CH3
that's a good example. So CH3 you have carbon you have drogen hydrogen but suddenly you have this big ass O sitting right and that is going to push all the other hydrogens's away from it. That means that it has more surface area for any other organic compound to come and attack. Right? So that tells you what molecule can be replaced or what part of the atom can be replaced.
00:10:00
The Admin: So the moment you start looking at organic chemistry in 3D you get really really good. I was really really good at organic chemistry because of SSR Morrison B and all is fine. So what data grids which capability SSR allowed me to be really good in organic chemistry. I can visualize I can think of What is how many electrons we have or how many positive or negative u field we have in the overall liquid. So if everything is very positive right we have a very positive field for
molecules that would mean the negatives are going to be happier and positive molecules are going to be slightly shrunk. So that gives you a shape of a molecule that also tells you which are the parts where some sort of action can happen. Then for example temperature allows a faster molecule to come in which means the locations which are difficult to get into can also be knocked off because now we have faster molecules.
The Admin: So all these concepts I still remember and this is what 2003 when I read and it goes back to the books I read. So if you are able to get the right data set on which we can train the model, then Believe me that our half the job is done. And this is why nobody in the world releases the data set. We'll see what they release. Even when we talk about Deep Seek and this Quinn and other stuff, They're releasing the model. They're not releasing the data set. And that's where the
actual key is. how should low resource indi be protected and expanded? it's a very interesting question and you and me need to answer this. should we create our data set and open source it?
The Admin: Should we create a data set and open source it with different kind of license which forces other people to share the data set back. These are some of the question that we have to take call because we will make this data set. Last time we didn't make any data set. We collected and we cleaned it up. But this time our motive is to actually create the data set also. And the last time is that you can create the data set. You can collect it but how do you do it without losing quality
provenence and evaluation integrity? For example, neat. I'm sure you're following neat and all the stuff that is happening for the resignation of ministers and other stuff, cockroach party. maybe you're following all of that, maybe What if you leak the benchmark itself into a data set? How do you make sure it does not happen? What is a leak?
The Admin: There's a question that is asked in the benchmark and somebody in the blog explain how that needs to be solved and that blog is part of your data set and you have trained on it as leakage cannot happen. Do you think that the model are trained on the benchmark data?
Pratik Pathak: Yes.
The Admin: We don't talk about it. That's like world. you do not talk about him. It does happen.
The Admin: we will talk about it but people are sort of aware to make sure that you cannot find whether this happens or not and if you think about it even if it happens and the model is not good otherwise then people will catch it so it makes sense to not actually make it a part of it but sometimes it does happen right it's not impossible for it to not happen so okay so first look at the corpus that we built last time what is it that we built what we had in this 1.118 billion tokens across
353 what is a shard thing?
The Admin: What happens is think about the training right so where is the data set let's say we have cleaned and we have done all of that where does the data set is going to sit on some S3 bucket what is S3 bucket is a S3 drive what is 3 S3 is a hard drive that is given to us by Amazon really fast free if you're using everything internally AWS very expensive if you're going to send your data from S3 to Google so Amazon doesn't like Google or Microsoft. So that's like tying in. If you're
using my data storage, you have to use my GPU also. So S3 is big ass stuff where you can save a lot, no limitations and very
The Admin: extremely fast, right? I've seen speeds of 60 GB PS for 128 threads running in parallel. So we could download terabytes of data in few minutes, So extremely fast. Now we don't store data as a separate file or separate document or separate text file there, right? that's going to be nonsense. That is how data is collected, not saved for the model. So How do we train a model? you're not aware of the concept called batching or sequence length yet but we'll talk about that later
on. So let us say we are training a model initially on a sequence length of 4, The meaning of sequence length of 4,000 that means that I'm giving examples to my model to train on each example has a length of four tokens. Right now I can give this once or I can give this 100 examples at the same time.
00:15:00
The Admin: 100 example at the same time would mean that I have a 100 copies of my LLM which are training on these 100 examples simultaneously and then I calculate loss. This is better because you get to see the variance. For example, if I just give one example that a bank is an institution where people can withdraw money or save money and can take loan and Second example the bank of a road is an angle which is decided based on the speed at which the vehicle needs to move. if you do not give both
the examples together or do not give both examples together once in a while then the model will get confused what is this bank you're saying finance institute you're saying this is a angle then you will say this is the bank or the corner of a river also. So more the examples that are seen together more I understand it can be used in many contexts right.
The Admin: So we want to give a lot of examples at the same time and then do one single loss right that way allows the model to understand okay this is how I need to look at all the things together that is why we had so many subjects in school also right sometimes things are linked now we had physics we had chemistry we had math if you go back then we had social science I don't know how many of you remember social science then English Hindi and the subjects of all of them together right
that's what we want for the model also so this
The Admin: batch size. Okay, and let's calculate this here. Let us say my batch size is 256. 256 means I have 256 copies of the model, which means my RAM, the GPU, the cluster I've taken is big enough to handle this kind of memory. So that's where You can ask where does this number come from? It comes from this multiplied by sequence length. So let's say 4096. 4096 is the length of the example I'm giving. So right now here we're saying that we have right now how many? 1 million. Are we clear on
this? We saying we are going to be running on 1 million token example bucket or example shard. Are we clear on this? with a very small shot.
The Admin: part is much bigger. I'll explain that. But is this part clear? This is going to lead one back prop. This is going to lead one training example or this is going to lead one correction of the model. Right? Last time I asked you that I was giving examples, you saw the loss also how the loss drops. There is only one example. Here we are saying we have 256 samples examples and each example is 4096. Now it can be slightly less than 4096. Can never be more than 4096. If it is less than
4096 then we have to send empty gaps because GPU doesn't like things that are not perfectly rectangle or square or cube right it needs everything to be fixed so try and when we now collect our data set and everything's cleaned up we're going to try and make examples of 4096 a Wikipedia page has 10,000 tokens what do we do we have to cut short no other way but 4,000 word is a lot of word already right so we try and make sure that we cut properly we save all that is required
The Admin: that it's nonsense. People just don't know about all of this. So you have to make 4096 length document in tokens. save them and together. Now when we are sending from S3 to our GPU which is going to be let's say B200 the data is going to move from S3 to our GPU and the data goes there. This is 1 million tokens on which we just back routed. What do we do for the second example? we'll send one more example and then GPU is going to train it and you see the problem I can't keep on
sending every example so what we do is we said okay let me u for 4,000 again you're going to see this 496 again this is because these numbers are divided by zero and overall in the overall scheme of things works better so 96 so we're going to say 96 yes so we're going to say that we have this
The Admin: And this around 400 million tokens ha So we make a shard of 400 million because it's easy to move from S3 to AWS where our training is happening. And again for 4,000 times I can train my model. This is one shard. So shard is a small bucket or small older zip folder. You can imagine it's a Python format. We're going to talk about it. It's a small cluster of things on which we can train the model continuously without thinking for a while. Right?
The Admin: And we decide best shape of the shot depending on the batch size we have depending on how many samples we want to push right we can push them parallely so size doesn't matter what does matter is that what is the storage you have on EC2 where B200 will be there that also doesn't matter you can make it as big as possible then why don't we move just all of that all the data there because the data is huge we have a lot of data talking millions there there we have trillions so we need
to be careful of what we are moving then we also have stages the first time the models is trained on simple thing. how are you trained? Right.
00:20:00
The Admin: First of all, had some at home. You had some basic training going on. After that, you went to school. It was formal. So, you have some books to go through. Then, ABC and all of that came in. you went to college, more training. From there, you went to your company different kind of Same training happens for our model. So, we can't just put all the data at once because it doesn't make sense. The training is going to change and based on that the data will also change. So here we are
saying our one sample has 4096 tokens in the sequence right.
The Admin: So if one word equal to one token then this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 right eight words here 4096 approximately okay this is a quick calculation and we'll start to agree on this 4096 divid by 1.33 so around 3,000 words 1.33 is the actual you can say fertility across all the languages everything mixed together that's the number you'll keep on seeing if you can change this number somehow to two you can
The Admin: see that now we are sending more words in the token right that's the reason you'll see that sometimes open AAI and Gemini have a tokenizer with 20 132 26 270 262,000 tokens and others are smaller so bigger the tokenizer faster the training but it has an effect on the model size also so we need to be very very aware of that okay so what is a shard a shard is a collection of data that we have saved processed and that is what
The Admin: we're going to be sending. So in our case we had 1.18 trillion tokens divided into 33,000 shots. Now we have in this data itself just for the training is initial part of training. We had three different kind of data sets. We had our main training pool D1 to D4. We named it students work on naming these and collecting the data sets for this particular stage. Then we had always on data and I'm going to explain why we had always on data. What is the meaning of always It says My
batch size is 256. and 8% of that is going to be 0.0 8. So around 20 samples for fixed right 20 samples I'll always pick from this always on data set. Okay, you're going to see you're going to understand why. And then I have something called golden proxy. So let's look at this and then you'll understand what is it I'm talking about.
The Admin: So in V4 corpus which is the era V4 we had 1.18 trillion tokens and across 330 33,000 blah blah blah shards and there this thing called opus. So we were using opus I'm going to change the opus explain the opus later on. So I'm just going to disable Look at the growth stage. So for the 1 billion tokens we had d3 d4 and always on this 8%. Just keep looking at that. So, I'll change the stages. You're going to see the amount of data I have for each one of them keeps on reducing.
The Admin: D1 is a web foundation where the whole internet is there where you can go and understand kit things about politics all the data is web whatever you find on the web it has news articles essentially in websites and other stuff right then we have web diverse which goes into the scientific and other fields also but it's not still scientific but it still gives you more idea so this is probably where your Indian times of India
The Admin: be when you say web diverse now we started adding Wikipedia and other sources of article also D3 is specifically code we wanted our model to be really good in code but look at what are we training on in 1 billion in 1 billion if we have examples in those 100 examples 40 42 are from the web foundation it needs to understand society social trees poems Shakespeare because I'm not going to give it a h lesson on Shakespeare all the random stuff that is there in the internet we are training
on that that's 42 30% is web diverse which is
The Admin: going to go in inside Wikipedia and other stuff 13% code right small bit of code is still there when the model is very small then we had D4 stem which is science and other stuff some science and other knowledge is still required but moment we move to B3 or 3 billion model moment we increase the size of the model you're going to see that we sort of have a equal split now right you can see that web foundation reducing we've increased the diversity and increased the code and
the stem for AB even bigger right this is going to college this is literally a nursery This is going to college with more emphasis on science and moment of your 120 we're talking about PhD level understanding So more on code and more on STEM. what happens is we want to say that our model is so right made in India made for India and so on. We want to claim that. if you want to claim that you have to give data set for that also right you have to keep on sending a data set. Problem is that you do
not have that kind of data.
00:25:00
The Admin: I'm going to show you below that we have for indig versus the amount of data we have for the rest of the world is this huge huge difference. So how do I make sure that my model understands our native languages? How does that work for NIS in US or Canada? Anyone of you aware of that? How does it happen? How do people move out from India to US or Canada and even though everything there is 99% English, how do they still speak the native language? Any example? Anyone one of you has any
idea on this?
Sandeep Kunkunuru: They're exposed to it before they migrate.
The Admin: No, no, no. Afteration, let's say migrate and…
The Admin: the kid happens there.
Rishikesh Kumar: Greg. Yes.
chirag Tagadiya: Are you you mean to speak a native language in USA?
The Admin: Question is parents move to US and…
Soma Korada: They speak.
Soma Korada: They speak at home.
The Admin: they speak at home there's always area. Yes,…
chirag Tagadiya: Yeah, we used to talk parents.
The Admin: there is an always on area where they speak this language that can be Gujarati or Marathi whatever they want to speak what are their native languages right and that has to be on since they are small so that's what we did here 8% of the batch is always going to be Hindi Marathi Telugu Tamil and other languages if we had not done that our model will be really really bad in the Indian languages this is something that we figured we thought really hard in the V4 and we came up with
this the reason I'm taking through all of this because You also will have to think of all of this when you start helping us make the data set and decide what are we going to be training on. Right? So let's go back here again. So B1 is a web foundation. we have then web diverse for when we move from one to three. What is the meaning of moving one to three? I'm going to simplify it to such an extent. It will sound stupid but that's a good starting point. We train the 1 billion parameter
model.
The Admin: We use the one billion parameter model weights to initialize a three billion parameter model. Right? So I'm not starting at a random weight. Then we train the three billion parameter model up to a stage. Then I use the 3 billion parameter model to initialize the 8 billion parameter model. Right? So I'm again not starting from scratch. And then we use the 8 billion parameter model to initialize 120 billion. If we had not done that, I don't know how much money we would have to
save. I just mentioned somewhere on a million dollar worth of training had to go for us to reach a stage. We reach a loss of 1 six. you'll understand the meaning of 1.6 later on. But that's hardcore. You cannot do it without training on the data that we did. Okay. let's click on 1B. What is D1?
The Admin: D1 is the foundation cleanest in the lowest entropy corpus which is based on English and carries the heaviest weight initially on you can see the stages as it is reducing web divers web online you're going to see CC tail common crawl CC stands for common crawl this is CC head and reddit everything that gets discussed on Reddit let's go to Reddit and see I don't know how many of you are on Reddit So this is how people discuss things on Reddit. let's say we open this right and people
start discussing. So this is the English it is getting trained on. I think you either didn't try GPT40 or server 105B in easy to medium level task.
The Admin: Right to that very short sentences this is literally Donald Trump speaking to that and learn smiling so something like that try complex structure so very short sentences and this is what initially our model is trained on so that's fed for us now moment we go to web de you're going to see that We have common call, tail, middle, refined web, CC news, air bat and indec are not global terms by the way. These is our terms school of air terms. So web diverse for us meant all of this but
for bhat also and then Indian cop Indic. These are two initiatives in India where people have data sets and we'll talk about how this is as good as Bangalore roads. These data sets are perfect way of saying it.
The Admin: These data sets are as good as Bangalore roads. Then In D3 we focus on star coder code tab and code clrf. You will find these data sets online. So we collected them clean them and put that back. And in stem we have pesto archive proof pile 4 and flat. You're going to see that depending on what you want your model to be trained on, there's different data set that you have to pick from, You have to pick different books on which you can train and that will keep on changing as we
proceed forward also. Now I want to come on I have a link on opus. So I came across this paper and this paper made so much sense that we made it a part of our model.
00:30:00
The Admin: So you can see that it's not old seven this paper already implemented by us. what this says is towards efficient principle data selection in large language model pretending in every iteration. And if you see this particular graph you can see that their model reached the same loss or same average performance at 8x the token. So instead of consuming 160 tokens at 20 billion tokens their model was as good as 160. What is happening here is we do have 160 billion tokens, So they're not
saying they didn't have They had 160 billion tokens, but they had a filtering process. When the model is being trained, there's a filtering process of whether I should actually get trained on this sample or not. And we ask the model itself. It's a very interesting approach. We'll discuss opus in detail later on.
The Admin: So as a model for example if I ask you should I teach you the name of the meaning of LLM at this stage you're in third session should I teach you the full form of LLM or maybe 100 times should I do that to you you're going to say no right you already know the meaning of it's large language model right so I can't keep on pushing the same thing again again to you but if I tell you that there's something called VLM or there's something called FLM you have learned something more So,
Opus has a strategy in which we can test in a fast way whether the model is actually going to learn from the sample or not and we select those samples from which it is actually going to learn. It's a very fast approach has expense also because it slows down training. You have to be very careful. But if you can do that, if you can figure out whether the model will learn from this data set or not, such an important question, you can hold the neck and ask the model because you will get very
frustrated with this learning or
The Admin: not right so if it says yes I will learn then only you send that data that's opus right so that's what we did now if you look from the opus lens then basically effective you can see 6x right so thisund the tokens we train on which is somewhere around 250 billion or 200 something let's say something so that effectively is 1.2 two trillion tokens right from the opus lens because for a particular stage opus was on for a three billion stage for us not 120 okay so that is opus and
we're going to talk about what opus is any questions till now before I proceed so are we discussing what we did in v4 all right we have pronai prana Right.
Pranoy Kundu: Hi. Yeah. I wanted to ask how did we decide on 8% a mean this from some paper or…
Pranoy Kundu: how did we finalize?
The Admin: No paper none of this we published it none of this is published on internet people will not talk about these things right so 8% for us…
Pranoy Kundu: Okay. Yeah.
The Admin: because it suits the batch we were training on one thing I did not mention is for example I told you 256 into 4096 right so we are saying we have a 1 million token as a batch that goes to the LM for training this is ideal this is what people like half a half a million to 1 million each batch should be there but you will not have a GPU that can handle this. So we have to be very clear on is possible what's not possible.
The Admin: So if you break it down, if you don't do this, if you just do 64, this will not fit on B200. By the way, even this will not fit on B200.
Pranoy Kundu: Okay.
The Admin: Right? So 8% essentially means that we have for example 16 batches. Can we send 8% of that into 0.0 It says 1.28 batch. What does it mean? We can't do that. So 8% though is sort of that kind of number. So when we are talking about 256 into 0.08 we're essentially saying 20 samples.
The Admin: So 20 samples were being sent always on it's a hunch kind of thing because if you ask me have you proven it that's question itself is have you done an ablation study you are asking me have you tested this on 15% 8% 5% have you trained your 120 billion model end to end 10 times to prove 8% is right I don't have that kind of money you get…
Pranoy Kundu: Makes sense. Yeah.
The Admin: where I'm going from you not run an ablation study at our scale on this. Sachin the cross model size.
00:35:00
Sachin Bharadwaj: Yeah, how do you find a distribution of training mixture for let's say 3 billion 8 billion those numbers right I understand 8% hunch but what about the remaining numbers in the distribution across model is
The Admin: This is how we wanted it
The Admin: to change this is again thinking again the question you're asking is have we done enough study to prove this is right not possible because in that case you're saying I have to run the whole experiment with different percentages and figure out what is the best percentage what I definitely knew is that we need okay by the way one very interesting thing how do you know we were right the question is you're asking a wrong question you're asking that how do you know this was
right I'm saying how do you know we were right after training
The Admin: So what we do is and that is a very very important insight and that again happened in the capstone stage when the model is being trained we have these unseen samples on which model has never been trained validation essentially and every once in a while we keep running the validation and we ran validation for everything we ran validation for the Hindi quality English quality science math ask it to make think something write a code everything and we are seeing those graphs going
up so as we're changing these samples or as we changing these percentages we are seeing
The Admin: that okay if I'm changing more on code that doesn't mean my science is going down or it is suddenly forgetting English India India's capital is New Delhi right so we have to have these small validations which can reconfirm that the model actually knows and…
The Admin: that's how we know whether it's going right or not because if you think from open air perspective also they've done an experiment they can't run the same experiment on 50 different values and then figure out this is the best thing vocab is same for We can't change the tokenizer…
Sachin Bharadwaj: My second question is for 1 billion,…
Sachin Bharadwaj: is it trained with 131K vocab size?
The Admin: because we are updating the weights of the model from the older one.
Sachin Bharadwaj: Okay. But…
The Admin: Tokenizer can't change some weights cannot change.
Sachin Bharadwaj: then in 1 million what fraction of the parameters are just the embedding and the output layer.
The Admin: Okay, very good question and I thank you for that question.
The Admin: So our vocabulary was 131072 tokens and my dimension the embedding was 4096 into two 1 billion parameters for embedding table and 1 billion parameter let's stick to this only okay half a billion embedding and half a billion head this is one 1 B is actually a misnomer it's 1.8 8 billion.
Sachin Bharadwaj: Okay.
The Admin: So if we had used what people do then 0.5 for the embedding plus 0.5 for the head where we predict and the total size is 1.8 minus 1.8
The Admin: 8 minus. So8 billion for the model…
Sachin Bharadwaj: and we are not using weight time here. Okay.
The Admin: but we can't use weight time because weight time is applicable only for small models. You're going to say this a small model. Yes, but we're going to use it to train 120B model. Weight time is only applicable if you don't know what is weight time is the first layer and the last layer can be tied inverse. If you don't know about this, we'll talk about it. But it's only possible for one and three stage, not for 8 and 120.
The Admin: Big models do not have weight time, So we not use weight time but this is school of AI and we invented something called chronical embedding which means this was not there. We never had any embedding to learn had something but literally fraction of it. So somewhere around 16 million parameters for embedding compared to half a billion and…
Sachin Bharadwaj: Okay, thanks.
The Admin: that's where that paper came in from chronicle embedding. Nikl every single stage we are right now just talking about the first stage…
Nikhil Shrimali: Ron this data distribution is for pre-training stage or…
The Admin: because in V4 we could only pre- post train a bit but this graph is about pre-train today we're going to talk all our target is
Nikhil Shrimali: okay so we trained on pre-training 1 billion and then we use the weights to initialize 3 billion and this was again the training not
The Admin: that okay there's a paper which I don't know how do I find it 101 BLM F this FLM11B so it's very similar approach right so what they did is an open how do trained with blah budget. They also seeded it. And there's a graph that you can see. Yeah, this was their stage. So they trained a 16 billion stage and then 51 billion stage and 101 billion stage. The target is to train a 101 from the beginning. So the logic is that we train a smaller one which can be seated to make the bigger
one and the bigger one.
00:40:00
Nikhil Shrimali: And my second question is when you have a 16 billion model,…
Nikhil Shrimali: so how do you initialize the weight for 51 billion model from the 16 billion? What happens the Okay. Okay.
The Admin: not possible to discuss today right today is only data set you are aware of it and…
The Admin: when it comes to that session we will discuss it if you really want to know then I've written everything in this 4day read link if you have time read everything is mentioned here it will take 4 days to Okay.
The Admin: sesh…
Suresh Mantha: How do we understand the difference or delta between regular training and with OPUS?
The Admin: how we'll discuss it when we discuss a simple answer opus paper is already there if you are interested you can read that as I said we asked the itself simple way of explaining today given where the course is but the details are there in opus paper in that link also you can find it here also Okay.
Suresh Mantha: Okay. Thank you.
The Admin: No, I'm saying I can't explain that in two lines, but we use the model itself, a proxy of it to figure out and we have
The Admin: a data set we never train on and we check with that data set whether this is going to help us or some of checking whether this data set is quality or not. Okay. M Okay.
M: So hi Rohan can you explain how did the calculations for stats you are doing right 256 into 4096 vary across examples I didn't get what is meant by 256 into 4096 So yeah they are like four.
The Admin: How many words are there?
Mahesh Sv: Demons.
The Admin: No, I want M M M asked me first. This is Shan. How many words are there? four that is 4096.
M: Okay. Yeah.
The Admin: Imagine 4096 along with this this is a cat also and I am an elephant also. So this I have 256 different examples of 4096 length. You clear on that?
M: Yes. Okay.
The Admin: That is one training data sample for us. This is called a batch.
M: Got it.
The Admin: Good. size varies across the batches.
M: Yeah. Also you were telling that means the size varies ac across the examples right across the batches…
The Admin: No, each bath is exactly same and we decide that before we start training.
M: but you told 256 into 4096 are the second time it will be 256 into 4096
The Admin: No, that's not what I said. I said I will save 204 I will save 256 into 4096 as one sample for my GPU.
M: Okay. Yeah,…
The Admin: But I will not send this I will send 4096 or any sample let's say I will save thousand samples on the hard drive. So I don't have to keep on sending every time from my S3 to AWS for the model to train. Otherwise the GPU will wait. Where is my data set? now it comes it process. So we keep it busy. Basically we keep this called cache. We keep a cache of thousand more samples.
M: got it.
The Admin: Okay. That's exactly correct.
chirag Tagadiya: So in this particular example you are saying that you will keep a 256 copy of the model. So I think that's wrong right?
The Admin: We have to have 256 copies mapped across GPUs of the same model to be able to process 256 different tokens. Otherwise, I can't have matrix multiplications for different things, right? I'm glad you asked…
chirag Tagadiya: Then what is your memory footprint for 256 different copy?
The Admin: because that is what and again really proud of what we did. So, right now we're talking about 9 120B sequence length is 81 192 batch size is a seven.
The Admin: If we do not use the optimizations we did then just for the seven batch size and let's take the number only 4096 batch size of seven let's go with the batch size of eight we need 367 GB of RAM compared to 99 for what we did and if we explode this you're going to see that I can't even hit 64 we need 2.5 TB of GPU RAM whereas in our case we'll hit something like 400 GB which is possible in a cluster of B200 How did we do that?
00:45:00
The Admin: We're talking about session 12. So don't ask me. Link is there for a 4 day reading. So we can read doesn't matter…
chirag Tagadiya: These are the sport instances or…
chirag Tagadiya: these were the sport instances or the on demand?
The Admin: how will matter. The GPU RAM will remain same.
chirag Tagadiya: No, I mean in terms of cost it will save a lot of money for you, right? Okay.
The Admin: But you do not have you stop at 268GB. How will you get more? Spot only gives you one set of 8 GPU.
chirag Tagadiya: Got it.
The Admin: You have to go for a regular one to get to use more than eight. Sleep. I didn't get the question.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: At what point were you looking at benchmarks at all? And can you quickly show how did we do 4 against benchmarks? At what point were you looking at benchmarks MMLU every time?
The Admin: Every time.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Were you using it for training in any way or…
The Admin: Every time.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: or were the data?
The Admin: Benchmark used for training.
The Admin: Benchmarks are used to no looking at that.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: No. For the data sets that they are using to validate the models you are not looking at them. Correct.
The Admin: And I also said that we use our own one second. she is the main student. Okay.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: f***. This is me.
The Admin: Is she here today?
The Admin: Are you here?
Shwetha D: Yeah.
The Admin: Yes, we have the validation server on mining channel, Yeah. But this is how it will look like on D1. We have held a sample and we seeing how good we are on that and D4 held out. Bengali. So these are very small shards or very small examples on which we are running a copy of the model. Every once you can see once in a while a checkpoint when can you run moment you have a model to save you can run.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Thanks.
The Admin: And you have to checkpoint a lot because it may just go your spot instance or your model can just crash. So you have to keep on saving it also.
The Admin: So you can see that we tracking it how it's going and that's the only way we can understand task see the amount of data I can train on in each path is same…
Tejaskumar Reddy J: Yeah so initially you were talking about how the mixture of the data set is different for each model parameter size right how are we so right now at 1 billion In 3 billion it's at 22%. So are we like reducing the amount of information it sees or is it just like there's more information for the other percentages?
The Admin: which means that I have to reduce for something else to increase. So here half the data is web when we go to 3B 8b is only 9% and 120 is even less.
The Admin: So you have to reduce.
The Admin: So increase something else because 256 is the bat size that can go inside GPU…
Tejaskumar Reddy J: …
Tejaskumar Reddy J: since on training the model weights keep changing, so how do we know that the information is not being lost?
The Admin: because I just said we keep testing it.
Tejaskumar Reddy J: Okay, got it.
The Admin: Okay, Dan.
dharshan thaigu: The first question is initially we have 1 billion and then 3 billion and 8 billion. the web will be initially higher then the stream will be little bit increasing.
dharshan thaigu: So is there any criteria we are purposely predefined that these are the only things could need to increasing or it is automatically doing all this thing initially.
The Admin: There's no What do you mean automatically doing?
dharshan thaigu: Yeah, this is why I'm asking the while separating it take 42% initially then it gradually reduces. So is there any criteria we are predefinedly input that this only improve on this?
The Admin: Yes. Yes, there is. And that's where I want all of you to think and this is the assignment by the way for you to think also. my intuition says and I don't know you will agree on this or not. if I were to give you not you let's say you have a kid and he's 10 year old and if I were to give him Iudo and ask him to solve what is he going to do?
00:50:00
dharshan thaigu: Can I repeat?
The Admin: If I give your 10-year-old child Ido and Morrison Boyd and ask him to read it, what will he do? Sleep.
dharshan thaigu: 
dharshan thaigu: Yeah, he tried. But yeah, it's only going to be the episode. No, no, I'm going.
The Admin: he'll sleep off right so there's a stage at…
dharshan thaigu: Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
The Admin: which I should be able to give him that book and that stage is definitely on the early stage so here I'm not saying that my model is trained on this more what I'm saying is that my model cannot understand code and stem enough because it does not have enough background but I'm training my model it becoming better to handle this kind of data called curriculum when do we feed a model what kind of data should depend on what the model has already been trained
The Admin: on that intuition is something we have to build. There is no recipe. We have to build on that particular concept that if the model does not know physics there's no point giving quantum mechanics book. Right? So that has to build up slowly. the ideal way of doing this would have been to take that tokenizer from a tokenizer figure out what tokens my model has already been trained on or what are the initial shards in which tokens are being used heavily and I keep on changing
that slowly. So I know that tokens that are used for quantum physics are increasingly more in the future stages compared to the initial stages because there is no other way of making a curriculum of this 30 trillion OpenAI has itropic has it Google has it we can't have it because this itself is going to take around thousand engineers working for a year to make it build.
The Admin: So we have to come up with some intalion approach of how do we do this and there are ways to it but it's part of the assignment. So I'll let you think first and then we'll discuss later on.
dharshan thaigu: Okay, one more question like open.
dharshan thaigu: So while we choose only open lens we have any alternatives for that or why only picking this here or…
The Admin: What is the question?
dharshan thaigu: specifically this around I mean can you hear me we have the 1 billion to 120 billion we are trained all the things but alternative we chooses oppus lens to effectively improvise all this training details and everything but why only oppus lens alone is there any alternative we are not thinking it or only oppose lens allowed here. I mean why only pick?
dharshan thaigu: 
The Admin: I have no idea…
The Admin: what you're asking. Opus is an algorithm that allows us to filter out quality data. What is the question?
dharshan thaigu: Yeah. allow us to filter the quality data? Why only choose open lens alone?
dharshan thaigu: Is there no more alternatives or only this alone? We can use it here.
The Admin: Okay, as I showed you,…
The Admin: Opus is launched in 6th of and that's why that's…
The Admin: what I do also. Opus is launched in February of this year, which means all the other approaches which came before it are not better than So the answer is in the recency and the overall paper quality. Army. I didn't get the question.
dharshan thaigu: Okay. Okay.
Harini Jasti: Hi Rohan. do you think OpenAI and all of the other models are doing this kind of process or they will be doing full fine tuning from scratch every time they train? basically right now so we are first training like 1 billion and then using it as a base model for next 3 billion and 8 billion right so do you think charge GPT also does that or every time it's releasing a new model…
Harini Jasti: then it's going to do it from scratch or is it also using the base models
The Admin: You're mixing two different questions.
The Admin: One question is the training strategy of open AAI and others as similar to this. Gemini and GMA I can say yes it is similar. They hint about it. People have stopped talking about it that there something I've mentioned the paper also people do not talk about using a seed model to make something else. They tend to show it as if that they have done the ablation study and then they are doing a scaling based on that. So people are not revealing whether they have done or not.
Nobody now even re reveals a paper and architecture itself. Charge JP has never revealed its architecture after 3 after three. Right? So nobody The second question you're asking is that if now we have a new model are we using the old model? Answer is no. A new model is a new model trained from scratch So every time you're seeing for example GPD 5.6 is now trained from scratch because the data it is trained on has changed.
The Admin: It's a data that keeps on changing with some architectural changes on the inferencing side and…
Harini Jasti: Okay, Eight.
The Admin: model architecture but it's mostly on the data side. So every time you hear a new model is trained from scratch. Okay Max you have another question.
Max: Hi. Hi.
The Admin: Okay. Okay, Max. The answer is no.
Max: Hi. So, I understand that you are changing the percentage of data. Let's say for example in different stages. But does the actual sample gets repeated in subsequent stages if there's one sentence in D1 state.
00:55:00
The Admin: Answer is no. We had way more data than we could train. So, not in our case. We'll talk about that in the bottom.
Max: One more thing that can we do use a separate model instead of opus lens like that is filtering the quality of the data would that be useful?
The Admin: You can think about it. let's say there are two students. Should I ask the student to do you think this is harder for student A?
Max: But let's say the second student has access to all the data. So you can initially it's just an idea is it doable.
The Admin: Doesn't matter. There are two different students. They have access to exactly same thing. Student studying. Should we ask student B student should student send this data. not doable. If you read opus you will see why and we'll discuss why also. So opus allows us to understand the model understands or not. So if you ask some other model to ask whether this model understands or not they will not correlate.
Max: 
Max: I see. because I was just asking because we are already having a test set for the checkpoints anyways.
Max: So that's why I see you.
The Admin: And this data quality selection changes also.
The Admin: It may not select quantum physics at all at the beginning but it may select quantum physics later on. So that is changing the way the behavior of the model is also changing.
Max: Thank you.
The Admin: Okay. Yeah.
Vardhan Walavalkar: Aron, you mentioned earlier that in a batch for example you'll have two different contexts for the bank code say for example so in this case for creating a batch…
The Admin: H should not have been random.
Vardhan Walavalkar: how do you select across these categories is there any criteria or is it random or something okay yeah thanks
The Admin: In our case, it was random. There needs to be some mind applied to it. Okay. Mjit.
Manjith Adapa: So the mixture that we chose from 1 million as we move forward the combination has significantly increased on the web drivers and code and…
Manjith Adapa: Is it that in the beginning the internet data is required and eventually as we move forward that's more static whereas web divers could still become more dynamic and…
The Admin: The no hold on hold on.
Manjith Adapa: more smart that is Got it.
The Admin: The answer is very similar to humans. let us say we were training an engineer to be short. this is how the last class should look like. We were training a computer science engineer literally if you were training a lawyer then the data is going to be very different and you will know what data to train on as we are pushing for the PhD what more data should come in while not dropping other data that is also important we do not want the PSD just on the law doesn't know anything about
Bangalore traffic we need to know that also so you cannot make a stage zero that's why the D1 is still there but you need to make sure that we are pushing the law the model in a specific direction so that's a question we need to ask before we train the
The Admin: What do we want in our case? We wanted an indic model. That's why it's always Doesn't matter what. And we wanted the model to be really good in coding and scientific thing because that's what we want the model to be used for.
Manjith Adapa: Okay, thank you.
The Admin: Okay. done.
Manjith Adapa: that it's mov
Vardhan Walavalkar: No, sorry. I don't have a question. I think
Sanjay Kumar: Roshan, I have last question probably. Yep.
The Admin: blind manage who's asking let's go line by line
Sanjay Kumar: So Roshan, let can you hear me? Sanjay, I'm sorry. Yep.
Soma Korada: So the always on that percentage of data is something…
Soma Korada: which we want our model to be expertise in and not necessarily an equal split of D1 to D4 Is it? Yeah.
The Admin: no I'll not use the word expertise I'll use the word…
The Admin: because I do not have good number of samples on indic data set if I do not keep on feeding indic right it will be a north Indian moving to Karnataka or Bangalore and just knowing Sulpa sulfa that's a max canal I know right so that's not cool so for every batch we make sure the part of the sample has a indicator so it is always refreshing that was our idea it was not to become an expert
The Admin: eventually it will become really good because we are feeding it but the logic was because the data is not equivalent I did not even run opus on this always on so opus will only look at everything else…
The Admin: but not this you can see 8% heights yes that is indic that is something fixed Okay.
Soma Korada: Got it.
Soma Korada: So the 8% data is not stagnant data. The data keeps varying. It's just that the domain or that language. Okay. Thank you.
The Admin: Yeah. Lightning.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: By the time the data reached S3, the tokenizer work has already happened and all the tokens are the ones that got saved in S3 crit. And do you have a listing of all the data sources and links to the actual data sets on lightning or any other place? Lightning has a list of all the data sets. Okay. Thanks.
01:00:00
Sanjay Kumar: Yeah so Roshan my question was like we say that 8% is always on for big languages right now let's say there's a topic on science which is explained in either Canada or Tamil I'm just giving that data sits in either 8% or…
Sanjay Kumar: it both sits in 39% because the words what we use either in local languages are much different than what we use in English also. Papa
The Admin: we are very very poor in the indic data sets that we do not have a luxury to classif further classify index science and…
The Admin: indic politics and indictory later on you'll see the mismatch the world data sets so what you're saying is
The Admin: been part of the science also but we did not have enough data set on indic normal forget English Spanish the whole data set is lesser than Spanish and in Indic we talking about hundreds of languages we could only train on 11 of them so
sonu agarwal: in older modules we used to face the forgetfulness I mean we used to get the forgetfulness issues. Do we have this in transformers or the chat GPT or…
sonu agarwal: it is not that valid now and…
The Admin: No, not valid now…
The Admin: because of the attention part and the baking of the embeddings.
sonu agarwal: what about giving the weightage to I mean I know there is an optimization and training is happening but still if we want to give weights to I mean we want a model to identify few things which may be not much of occurring like you mentioned in indict data set so that's how you use the 8% I mean that's…
The Admin: Yes. Yes.
sonu agarwal: 
sonu agarwal: how you select the 8% Presenting.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: and the lack of data did not seem to hurt the Google translate or the original transformer homework came from there right how did they solve that is it a different problem so it's not constrained by data so indic data is less in quantity compared to English data.
The Admin: I want you to validate what
The Admin: just said by some data because what is just said is completely false. What is completely false?
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Correct? No.
The Admin: You're saying Google translate solve the whole general LM problem while being really good at Indian data sets which is wrong.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: No. the translate service alone not the LLM as it exists right now.
The Admin: Translate is a different thing.
The Admin: translate you have data…
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Okay.
The Admin: but there is no equivalent data to the amount of knowledge you need to have for translation is very less compared to being able to recite the constitution of India in Tamil right very different problem m gooden proxy is something that is used in opus so…
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Different problems. Okay. Yeah.
Mahesh Sv: What is a golden prophet proxy? Okay.
The Admin: what happens in opus we have a data that we never train on but that defines what is the quality data we use that data and then see how is the model doing on the thing that I'm a model. It's like a test. So I have a test every time I'm sending data to the model. I check using opus whether my model has become good on this or not. If not then I will see the samples and see which samples allow my model to be good on this test and I only use those samples. That's the golden proxy. When
we discuss op we'll discuss more on that. Kaman will be the wan with the last question.
The Admin: M Check it.
Udit Singhania: So my question was you remember in the first session you told that this time we will mainly focus on the coding domain and the last time it was main focus on in league domain. So 8% what type of data…
Udit Singhania: then can we send this time that because 35% is already the coding domain here.
The Admin: What is the question?
Udit Singhania: this time we'll focus mainly on the coding domain right in the LLM part okay so AON will be the indic part for this session Okay,…
The Admin: No, this time also our model needs to be really good indicating and for something to be good at coding you need to be really good at stem.
The Admin: Yeah, I don't know. this is V4. You guys need to decide that will you actually help me get a good quality data set? It depends on you.
01:05:00
Udit Singhania: thank you.
The Admin: Come on.
kamran shaik: So, if I do a rough math, 1 billion tokens is equal to 1,000 copies of 256 cross 4096 the example that you gave.
The Admin: 1,000 copies of what?
The Admin: 4. There are three numbers here.
kamran shaik: So correct.
The Admin: This is a One 1 billion token shards.
kamran shaik: Yeah. Yeah. So for gathering these many tokens and the data which consist of these many tokens, how do we even assess the quality of the data manually?
The Admin: That's the assignment that you also need to work on. That's the later onet section. I'm just at the very beginning of session. Okay. Well done is the last question.
The Admin: Well done.
Vardhan Walavalkar: Yeah.
Vardhan Walavalkar: So in the context of training for example the indic languages for which we have less data these are called low resource languages right and there are some techniques specific to that for example in text to speech domain at least. So are we going to cover some techniques to handle this?
Vardhan Walavalkar: I mean lack of data in Indic using any techniques. Okay.
The Admin: Yes. Yeah.
The Admin: As a V5 group, you guys need to take a call on that. All right. Let's move on. Sorry, I had to lower the hands of others because we have to talk about the sessions other sections also. We will take all the So, question is what data set is not for only thing that you are aware of right now which is a training is I have 4096 samples and my model is predicting one token at once. That's just a pre-training data set. This is where a model is learning about knowledge code such
structure and umbrella the United States of America and so on and so on and New Delhi, New York, those kind of things it's learning here. That's a training. It's a document. It's 4096 words together. That's all it ends there. Then we have mid-training and part this is where the high quality documents come in. Again a document size but the quality of document is really good. The English is really good.
The Admin: Imagine Sushnas Swaras talking Hindi that kind of Hindi really really good language constructs and things right is not what we are focusing here this is how the news person will speak or what is the name the documentary guy or John Pumpkins look at this animal that Right. What bug?
Mallikarjun sajjan: David Cotton.
AJ Jain: David Adamo.
The Admin: Adam, Look at That guy. So that kind of English we have really really good tur those are the things that the mid training needs to happen on the math the reasoning it's literally a documentary level kind of English that we have. Then we have supervised fine training. Now this is where we have instruction response pair.
The Admin: This data set is different. Here we have a question and an answer, Write a letter to my manager that I'm not And then the actual letter will start. We have to collect that. The model loss now does not include write a letter to the manager. that is not part of the loss. So again the law structure has changed here a bit and this instruction response pair is something that you keep hearing anthropic claiming that somebody stole my data a n t h r o b p i c you have a sto data
set when you're hearing this news accuses Chinese rival of illicitly extracting AI capabilities. This is what is happening.
The Admin: So you or China can take 10,000 accounts of anthropic and create this instruction response data set. You ask a prompt, you have a prompt and you get a response and you see this is how model behaving. So that data set is gold. This is one of the most important data set because these two data sets you have available online. You can train on it but this is really really gold. After that we have preference optimization. This is where the charge GPD in India is going to say a
different response by the way right if you are in India and you have Indian account if you ask what happened in some case in India answer is going to be different compared to when you're outside India this is where the good and the bad answer is selected this is where a human is required to sit and say no this is not the right thing to say for example in India you can say a black person but you can't say that in US you have to say American African right so those preference and as a model you
can
The Admin: Never say that. So all of those biases are induced here. We are not. So two ways of looking at it. Either we're removing a bias or we are actually adding a bias. I think this more like adding a bias, right? You're positioning the model to never talk about tan man square in China. Nothing happened Same thing in India also. all political parties are really good. So you have to get that kind of thing because you don't know who comes to power tomorrow. So this is where we have sort of a
chosen and rejected responses. We send all we take the question we write the answer in two forms. This is bad this is good. We send to the model and ask the model tell me what do you think is For example there's a question on Rahul Gandhi and it has two answers. You send both of them and you ask the model what do you think is the right answer? It has to say no this is the right way of saying Right? So that is where the structure comes in.
01:10:00
The Admin: That is where you add the biases and make sure that it's really good for your country and the way the model is going to be used. And then we have this Reinforcement learning really is very very long rollouts. This is what happens when you're talking to plot code and you have a long data or long historical chart that goes back to the plot so they can train it better. This is where we have a prompt agenda trajectory. This is how we want the model to think about. For example, when
you say make an itinary for me for 7 days for Japan under (,000 budget, a (0,000 budget and I'm vegetarian. So how does the model need to think that breaking of the thing happens in the reinforcement learning part? Because what is re in re reinforcement learning?
The Admin: learning you get the reward at the last stage. You do not know reinforcement learning is It's like life. You were told school then you were told no not now you have to You did college and say college then you were told no join a job take a job. Then said no get married get married got married. Have three kids two kids. Buy a home. Pack car. pay the loan by the time you die that is reinforcement learning.
The Admin: So reinforcement learning reward end you have a very very long roll out of things and after that you took a right step or not right that's reinforcement learning and that is required okay so one pipeline many data sets so initially for the pre-training we have some number of tokens and you can see the I wanted to focus on the amount of data set that is required it on dropping the quality is really really good initially we're talking about depending on model size by the
The Admin: So, initially if you have around 1 to 15 trillion tokens, you will have somewhere around 50 to 800 billion tokens. You can see that 120th of that is required for mid training. Good quality solid data set in the SF stage drops further. Now we're talking about only 100k to 1 million samples anthropic you and me can do it. 200 people we just record our own discussion with cloud or launch some API and we can collect this data set easily. That's why this is the most important stage and
easy to collect or steal data also. Then we have preference optimization. This is where things get slightly tricky because who exactly are you making the model for right? Because if your model is really let's say open about things and then we have someone from political party testing your model and they really want to screw you. They'll just take the answer and just that is what keeps happening with meta and Microsoft.
The Admin: They launch a model, people test it, they break it and then they launched a news in the article that my model was abusing me. And then we have this RLBL R which is reinforcement learning. Here we have really really good 10 to 100K prompts. These are very difficult to get because this is a long history on cloud or other models or written by humans where we have turn and run thinking processes. So each stage the data it differs. This is for text for coding is going to be slightly
different. Audio is going to be slightly different for vision is going to be slightly different but we are focusing on text as of now right so if you see on text we have again fine web we have DCLM we have never drawn when we move to mid any stage we have dolmino synth math when we move to SFT these are the only opensource data set I can refer because that's someone we can use if we don't make our own for SF we have small talk we have tulu we have open hermes for the preferences we have
ultra feedback help three skyrocket sky
The Admin: book. And then for Rud, we have GMSK doing a math. and code unit test is some of the data sets that you need to be aware of. comes how much data and what does it mean. So here we have a law which is called chinchilla scaling law. let's do a quick search for chinchilla. So not a very very old paper but basically this is what it shows.
The Admin: What you're seeing here is the 6E18 1 983. what is this? Anyone? let me show you this. This is even better.
01:15:00
Tejas: The learning Eight.
The Admin: Look at this. And what I want you to notice here is on the bottom, let's look at this later on.
The Admin: Okay, on the bottom I want you to see 6 billion, 30 billion. That's the size of the model. How many parameters we have in the model? And here we have a training loss. 3.2, 3.0, 2.8, 2.6, 2.4, 2.2, 2.0. Right? So loss is reducing Our parameters are increasing like this on this axis. this is the amount of compute we have decided. How much compute I'm going to give to my model. This is in flops and za flops and exaf flops So what you're seeing is that if the computer decided this is a
6e18 compute floating point how much processing power we are giving to a model and your model is here and that means there's a small model you can actually increase the size of the model for that compute and this is the sweet spot but that's the loss you're going to hit. You cannot go lower than for that compute. So you're seeing three accesses at the same time compute money basically how much money you want to spend.
The Admin: So this is the amount of money you want to spend. So as you spend more money, that you can train better. But for amount of money, the scaling loss predict the size of the model and the loss that you're going to very interesting. So I know if I have a million dollars and this is the size of the model, that's the loss I should hit. And this is something that is being used for ages now. Every single lab uses it. every now and then there's a new blog or new thing that comes out and
says though this has been proven wrong but this is a really really good standard to follow.
The Admin: I want you to notice one more thing. not this one. This is the table that you saw. It's a sort of a straight line you see and very very well defined. There's a very simple table and the moment you look at this table that's a table. I want you to take the parameters and tokens and divide tokens by parameters and tell me the number you see fast. If you're not sleep you can do it fast. Tokens divide by parameter. What is it?
Sandeep Kunkunuru: 20
The Admin: Quick 20. So chinchilla law says that one parameter should have 20 tokens. So if you're making a 1 billion parameter model, you should train it on at least people assume that this at least on 20 billion tokens. That means if you have 120 billion parameters, you have to train it on 2.4 trillion tokens. We trained it on 200 something.
The Admin: So we were already onetenth the overall training that was required but we did hit 1.8 to 1.6 six kind of loss which means that we actually trained it on something like a trillion tokens right so that's where optimization other things will come in but this gives you a really good idea okay let's go back to this table now token budget and scaling explorer so we're talking about chinchilla law chula law says that around 20 tokens per parameter are required for a model now I will
change it and when we change it you'll see the graph changes and all that's just for marketing but I want you to look at this
The Admin: thing. So this is where we are. This is small LM. Okay, this is trained on 6,471 tokens per parameter. Massively overtrained. 2,00x more. this line is 2,000x more. Here we have massively undertrained, only 1.7 tokens per parameter model. Here we have Kim K2 is very famous right now is one of the good model that is out there.
The Admin: Gamma is 533. Then we have Quen which is around 153. Then you have Llama Scout which is 1,200. Then you have something like Llama 4 Scout which recently released. We have GLM 4.5. We have Llama 4. We have DC 26. Then you have DC V2 34. This is Then Chingela itself so on and so on. where do we want to be? We want to be We want to be Here. It's a question that I don't have answer for that. My observation is and I would like you to draw your own observation is when the models are
smaller, they tend to go in a higher token size. This is what industry is following. This is the line of the law. Where the model is really good and big, then this is where I'm seeing most of the models are right.
The Admin: So I think around 100 tokens or 150 tokens per parameter is going to be our target. You need to be careful on thinking about it. You need to come up with your own intuition. I cannot pass on my intuition to you. I cannot tell you that I think this year the stock market is going to behave. Why do I think I can't do that? But you to think what do you think is going to be the right strategy for us. So no clear answer here. when we run out of fresh data, what is it that we can do?
01:20:00
The Admin: This is something that somebody else was also asking and this is a table that can guide you a little bit. imagine that you have 100 billion unique tokens and you want to train for one trillion tokens. If you do not have data, what you can do is basically train on it again and again and So let me start from here. If I have 10 trillion tokens and my target is 1 trillion, I do not have to worry about repeating a data. But if I have less and less data, I need to repeat on the
same data set. But after this four line, I will not be able to get something good out of it. And when you are at something like 16 times or 16 epochs or training on the same data 16 times, you are at no return zone. So somewhere around two to three is the max you can actually train on the same data without affecting a lot.
The Admin: If you look at others they had enough data always to not be even worried about right we were in the free zone we had enough data to train on our target so that was never a problem V5 we have to think about how much we are going to be training this is llama 3 and this is coin right so to answer the question that can we repeat the data set maybe twice less than four is you can already see it's dropping right so we do not have a lot of options so that line needs to come back and come
back And this is too big. 36 somewhere around here. which means one is to one after that we are not getting good returns here. After that is very bad. So we need to be careful about repeating our data set. this is the token reality. We have chinchilla. We have frontier only. Let's look at frontier.
The Admin: Right now people are training massively. This is 30 trillion and 30 trillion and 20 trillion and so on and so We train on a poor level. We need to now figure out where do we train our model. My hunch is that we are going to be targeting something like 10 to 30 trillion. I don't know yet. But depending on how good you are and how much you are helping in actually making a data set that number seems possible. And yeah that's the target essentially. So if you ask me that is my hunch
today assuming that all of you are going to do this is another interesting thing that we have and this is again linked to one of the question the student asked which is what do we do for a data set that is not there or what do we do with the indic and other data sets. Right now here you're seeing The blue line talks about the usable public text that is already out there.
The Admin: The yellow line is the demand of the data set that is there right now. So overall we feel this is a public data that we have that overall we have somewhere around 300 300 trillion token data data is there publicly available that can be crawled and that can be worked on. Right? So let's look at three things. This is a normal scenario. The data set available to us is somewhere around 100 to this is a lock scale. So by 2028 we'll have somewhere around 300 trillion tokens if we can
scan the whole internet. If we are open AAI and Google but if we add synthetic data then that level can be increased right we will not go out of data for at least a year. If we add all the multilingual data set then probably we'll have one more year left before we exhaust all the data set and if we add license data set deals and all then we can capture more.
The Admin: This is where I think most of the data sets lives today where people do not have access. For example, RBI will have triions of documents, Trillions of tokens and documents Same goes for bank, same goes for other agencies that are there. And then finally This is where I wanted to spend time and think carefully where the data is coming from and how do we know our model is really good at a particular topic. This goes back to benchmark. So we have these few benchmarks that we need to
target. for a quick understanding of where these benchmarks are u just look at gamma 4. Yes. Right now this is normal page but the way people talk about their model is there's live bench code forces GPQA to HLE humanities last exam big bench MLU vision pro and so right this is how we know that how good the model is.
The Admin: So when we are selecting a data set we need to be aware that if you want MLU then the data set needs to come from educational code multilingual books stem instruction but we can do reverse also if you say that I'm going to focus only on education web then forget ever solving human evolve or GMS kit which is other stuff if you say I'm only going to train on coding then that means only these three can be targeted. So really you have to do a mix and match. So there is no way that
you can say there's one data set you train on your model is going to be Einstein no and this is basically where a lot of time is spent to understand where do we find what kind of data set we need for being a good indic right you can't say I'm a doctor unless you do MBBS and after that PG you can't be a good engineer unless you have an for engineing degree you have to clear a test these are those tests
01:25:00
The Admin: So how do we know we are good in coding the benchmarks and then how do we know we are better than somebody else in that benchmark that model is I want to be at X plus something right which means if I want to be really good at coding I'm targeting ML arc and human eval in human eval I will go to here I'm going to see human eval is not mentioned here altogether but okay there at least value is there right gamma is at 85.2 I need to be better than gamma so I need to be better than
gamma in value and they are at 85.2 that's how the thinking has to happen for model okay I'll come to that in a moment any question till now okay Sachin
Sachin Bharadwaj: Yeah so ro you show different phase of training right so even let's say in pre-training or in SFT do you have always on mode for indic languages Okay.
The Admin: Yes. at least 20 tokens.
kamran shaik: we spoke about Chenula So where we discussed that for every parameter we need to expose it to around kens at least 20 tokens. So that is the combination of pre-training plus SFT plus preference or Okay.
The Admin: Here we only talking about pretending which account for 90% data set.
dharshan thaigu: Yeah yeah yeah the data sets we have the mid training SF preferences so these things we have been eventually reducing the token count…
The Admin: Okay.
dharshan thaigu: which we are using initially so my first question is it training is the base model then moving forward we move to because we always predefine the token so here the m training will be the third stage four so it is more like a refining with the one specific segment or Why we are reducing this token steps?
The Admin: Why we reducing the token? Because we first want a general knowledge about the world that will involve BJP something happened in Kolkata. But we want the model to be good in coding also. Right? So how much can you have can you make one trillion tokens for Python can't right?
dharshan thaigu: No. Okay.
The Admin: So the knowledge there is condensed in this very specific domain and we want it to be really really good in that domain.
The Admin: So you cannot even come up with a one trillion token data set just to learn Python. It's not there.
dharshan thaigu: …
dharshan thaigu: and one more thing is after this.
The Admin: One more thing information knowledge that should immediately answer your question.
dharshan thaigu: Okay. Okay. And one more thing why you are specifying with the supervised it's only for instruction response thing. And another thing is good or bad the preference optimization on the reinforces almost we have been giving the prompt to build something.
dharshan thaigu: So is there we predefined specific for this SFT preferences or oral or we are choosing this for this particular task.
The Admin: No, that is…
The Admin: how it's possible. For example, you have a daughter. she looks at an auntie that comes in and says auntie I bought motto what is the first thing you are going to say name it that is what we're doing she is fat she comes in and…
The Admin: the girl said she's not wrong so this is where the bias has to come from a human point of view no this is not how you speak right just can you tell your wife that the food she
dharshan thaigu: No for these details for preferences only we choose for good or…
dharshan thaigu: bad right are why you are choosing preferences is it predefined only to use for good or bad no Okay.
The Admin: made today is very bad. These are preferences that have to be taught and these are human preferences. Otherwise, the model is going to be blunt. It's going to say bad food.
01:30:00
dharshan thaigu: Okay. Okay.
The Admin: Human preferences. How do you talk about politics? How do we speak to a boss or our employee or a driver or a kid? These are preferences which are human defined.
dharshan thaigu: Okay. Understood.
Sanjana Tule: So when we say 15 trillion tokens it means that we have taken all the training data tokenized it and just literally counted it.
Sanjana Tule: That is 15 trillion. So we have counted it and not train on the whole thing. We might train only on the sampling of whatever we are doing.
The Admin: Then we don't…
Sanjana Tule: So the sampling might be okay.
The Admin: then we don't say we train on 15 to pre-training,…
Sanjana Tule: 
Sanjana Tule: Got it. and second question was in the earlier part you showed the 9 billion 120 billion that is literally pre-training right we are talking this is pre-training and…
The Admin: pre-training, and post training in 120B.
Sanjana Tule: post training where is the little bit post string and…
The Admin: We did a small post training.
Sanjana Tule: that 1 V3 V8 B 120V is the model size okay got it thank
The Admin: Yeah. Yeah. Sep.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Yeah, again carrying forward from the previous question on translate if we don't have index data sets can we translate and create indic data sets the preferences will go ahead Okay.
The Admin: We will talk about that in next session today only. Okay. Naga Pawan Kumar.
nagapavankumar kalepu: Rohan regarding the benchmarks right so based on coding we have to target these benchmarks that is you mentioned there and if there is some specific domain such as let's say marketing and sales or finance etc how generally come up with the right benchmarks like a specific domain like you right now coding I think there are certain benchmarks I mentioned let's say…
The Admin: What is again? Correct. No,…
nagapavankumar kalepu: if it's some other domain let's say finance or marketing and sales etc Yeah.
The Admin: but how do people come up with benchmarks?
nagapavankumar kalepu: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. How do people come up with benchmarks on a specific domain?
The Admin: Yeah, you create a task, solve this task.
The Admin: Literally We create a browser based task.
nagapavankumar kalepu: Okay.
The Admin: Open Gmail. Go there and figure out things that. Okay.
Dattatreya Manjunath: My question is about the RL part. it says it'll have about from 20 to 20k prompts there, So does it assume that every conversation let's say that's been for training has reached termination or…
Dattatreya Manjunath: whatever the user was desiring and on top of that after a point the conversations usually saturate as in the LLM model does not usually respond correctly right let's say the context is complete and stuff like that so in that case how do you have conversations with such long prompts and stuff like that for it to train on top of.
The Admin: I didn't get the question.
Dattatreya Manjunath: So when I looked at the RL block, it said 20 to 200k prompts there.
The Admin: That is a stealing way.
Dattatreya Manjunath: So I was just trying to understand how they're just training it on top of whatever conversations already been had and okay…
The Admin: Otherwise, we hire hundreds and thousands of people to actually write these long conversations and train on.
Dattatreya Manjunath: then there's no model involved there my concern was that you cannot have such long conversations currently.
The Admin: before 2024 we had people working in coding they had history in g so all of that okay our validation drops we continue to validate our model against something 100%.
Dattatreya Manjunath: Okay, bye.
Nikhil Shrimali: Rohan u what happens when data set has no entropy essentially we are saying the same thing again and again and model is not learning any new information is there a measure okay so that can be possible even though we have huge number of tokens but we are still in waste zone because
The Admin: We're going to see how the good quality of indic data sets we're going to talk about it.
The Admin: Such this empirical data empirical…
Sachin Bharadwaj: Yeah, you showed a graph right where if you train for multiple epochs, you have diminishing returns. that is from empirical evidence of school of I mean internal experiments or papers. Okay.
The Admin: which means papers no we couldn't go past the post training also kesh
01:35:00
Sachin Bharadwaj: And also in era V4 did we have RLVR as a step in posting? Okay.
Gitesh Grover: So here it started with What were the data set requirements for the tokenizer? I mean is there a relation can we reuse that data that we use for the tokenizing?
Gitesh Grover: here or because if the data for data set is not seen from the tokenizable it can lead to some errors behavior from the model right
The Admin: If you ask this question half an hour after that will be really great.
The Admin: I need to cover something to answer that. Good question.
Balaji Chunduri: So you're talking about the diminishing returns right while training beyond four repos.
The Admin: Yeah. Had you train better on a new data set,…
Balaji Chunduri: So is it that the learning that happens is not worth the cost we spend. Is that the …
The Admin: you would have had more learning.
Balaji Chunduri: because usually in computer vision traditional deep learning we train for 100 200 epochs long time.
The Admin: There you also heading right.
Balaji Chunduri: So there we don't see the cost because maybe we see the overfitting but sometimes the training goes on for a long time there even though we don't see overfitting for a long number of epochs…
The Admin: You do see overfitting after a long epox.
Balaji Chunduri: but even 100 epochs is common there right but here you're saying four epochs itself is too much okay okay and…
The Admin: The text the same thing is said in multiple different ways in images. That's not there.
Balaji Chunduri: just one more question so regarding the 1 billion to 120 billion model progression stages. So only 120 billion onwards all these different training strategies will come in for first three stages it's only training nothing else it's always language model right no other yeah thank
The Admin: Nothing else. Raw model All right. So the one thing I wanted to take out from here is that we have the synthetic data set option that we need to explore properly. Can we make it and so on and so And we then spoke about which data buys you which capability. We need to have a really good chart of this. We need to extend this further.
The Admin: We need to understand that if you want a model to be called a good indic model, what does it actually mean? How will we test it? Same goes for coding, right? We have some benchmarks, we have some GMA and charges, they keep pushing what they are really good at. But the amount of validation or amount of tests that these companies do that itself is more than 40 times the budget we have to train our model. So be sure that you can't list down thousand tests for the model because we don't
have money to just go through those thousand tests.
The Admin: So we have to be very selective that these are 10 that we'll follow and we are going to target these 10 benchmarks right it's like saying I'm only going to target J if I clear J I know ALE would have been cleared so we'll hope that's true not neat right need is different so for neat we have to pick one or for medical we have to pick one okay this is interesting and this is something that Amazon did a really good amount of work on now code and math are capability literally are fueled
together what do I mean? So let's say we have our natural language reasoning, right? This is text only. This is world knowledge and this is generated win rate. can you also write a letter to my boss?
The Admin: boss or something like that. Moment we add code you see all of these capabilities also go up and you can think why you can build your intuition around it. My intuition is that coding is actually logic right. So when we ask a model to write a code we're asking it to actually think in logic and then write that and that logic creation can help in other scenarios So cross domain training is something that people have seen increases not only that capability but also increases other
capabilities. Right? same we have something that people have experimented and proven also.
The Admin: So for example, We are starting with a small set of good math pages such as math Q&A and we are training on that. We train a fast text classifier. Basically the data we are training on. We figure out from there we extract more math and we train on that. We basically crawl internet and extract more math and we train on that. So if you keep on doing this and this is while the training is happening or after training has happened. If you keep on taking math from internet from the data
you've already trained on or from new crawl and keep training your model just on the math part you're going to see that overall the performance of the model increases in another domain also right this is something that we need to be aware of that hitting a specific domain or specific capability or gym will improve the overall performance of the human or the model right so that's something that people have explored a lot and we need to be aware that this exists and this is one way to
fix a model
The Admin: Once you have spent a lot of money in training a model and you're not happy about a particular domain, two options, retrain the whole model, make sure somehow we hit that capability or pick that domain capability and then crawl and then train on that particular Risky bet, but that's one option to come out of a expensive mistake that has happened. And now then we have quality over quantity. For example, if your data is really s**, there is no way you can actually improve the
quality of the model. And here are a good example. If you have a raw unfiltered web or token and corpus is 2.6 trillion, 57% of the raw comparable is MMLU.
01:40:00
The Admin: But we have these capabilities or these models these are three different data sets essentially right DCLM baseline is a data set on the same model extracts the data set in a specific opus is OPUS should have been one of this component but opus is algorithm so I have not kept it here so DCLM baseline is extracting data set in a specific way that you can see that immediately quality goes from 57 to 64 then we have fine web edu very small data set 1.3 trillion but itself allows
us to hit 41%. Then Neotron one token from one trillion token it extracts good quality data set and takes a model to 59%. So these are few benchmarks that we need to be aware of and look at how the trading quality affects that particular benchmark.
The Admin: very very serious for us. Then what is a First of all, frontier scale usually follows two-stage pattern. A strong model labels a manageable sample for educational value, correctness, structure, domain events, achieve model learns to build on that. What are we saying here? Now we have downloaded this 20 trillion How do we say this data set is math or science or indic or Hindi and so on and so on.
The Admin: If you one way is to send it to charge 30 trillion tokens to charge not possible okay why don't we install a small model and then send to that small model even to do that trillion tokens for 30 trillion tokens our budget is just going to go there can't do that also so what other labs do to train a quality classifier a very small model so you're not even an very small model to which they send a part of the data and ask do you think it's science and so on and so Right? So this is
the recipe from the labs where they tend to classify the data and then they distribute data for different buckets.
The Admin: So if your corpus is English for example and you're training on it I wanted to look at this part on the bottom okay and I want let me zoom out a bit okay so your copy is m mostly English and we can increase the overall threshold of how difficult our quality selection is five is basically you're rejecting everything and one zero is something that you're keeping everything. So the kind of samples that you would keep will look something like this. So this got a 4.8 score. A pair
review explain around how photosynthesis covered light through chemical energy and so on and so on. But look at the bad ones also. Autogenerated category page seven of 312 of wall of product titles and prices that is also in the data set. Should we train on this line or the same keyword paraphrase repeated 40 times with a filter between?
The Admin: Should we train on it or boilerplate footers like terms and privacy and copyright social or for example opinion blog with few good points but heavy. We have to figure out a way in which we can classify this right and based on that you need to understand that how much of the document you're going to keep how many tokens are going to get rid of and what is the overall quality if your quality is like Oxford level and everything hits five then there's nothing that you can so
this is very very critical right if your corpus is Hindi for example then you can read Hindi and figure out same for Hindi and Telos so we have to come up with a classifier for our data set to understand that'm I'm not going to keep Right and that is a critical thing it requires a lot of thinking a lot of intuition on how do we decide the data this shard I'm going to train on because there is a lot of crap on internet when we say 30 trillion token that is the whole internet with random nonsense
also They're
The Admin: And this is a very very important part. Now this comes in when you become famous. If you write a model and the model is beating all the benchmarks. Then people are going to say that have you removed the data which is there in your data set which is a leaked exam or leak benchmark. If you don't do it then you will get caught. So if you don't do duplication everything is there. If you do a global removal then you're going to see that half the data set is going to be removed. Then
we have something called per snapshot. So I want to explain this particular part. common crawl is a big data set of the 30 20 trillion that we're talking about and every year they come up with a snapshot. So we download the common crawl snapshot of a year of internet right so we have a 2024 common crawl snapshot everything that happened in 2024 internet download 25 download 23 download 24 download and…
01:45:00
Ranjani Chandrasekaran: What's
The Admin: so on.
The Admin: When we dduplicate when we remove the content from our own content only for example there's article on India written in 2024 there's an article on India written in 2014 there's article written on India 2004 so if you go with the nonsensical approach of seeing India article remove all the dduplicates and only keep the latest one you will actually throw away half the data and this is a trickier problem because we're not asking LLM you are going to come up with a heristics to
throw away the data So we have to make sure that we are not doing a global removal. If you do global removal that will throw things away. We have to go yearly in the bucket and see per year have we repeated the data or not. Right? So dduplication is also very important because if you don't do it you'll end up training on little garbage. If you do it in a abusive way you're going to throw away 58% token. So we have to do a per snapshot. Right? Again a big problem people are not aware of.
The Admin: And then we have a talk on this integrity data set. here I can't even read this. We have a Telugu. Can you go on mute Thank you. So I t read but the way we generate centric data sets there are few options. here we are saying I can translate in English by the way. I can read tu and real time translate in English. This says electricity is a form of flows through wires and light lamps and run machines, right? Magic. So, one way is going to be a rephrasing, right? I can't read
Telugu, but I can do a real-time English translation because of the AI sitting inside. Electricity is a form of energy that flows through conductors. That is a really really good way of creating synthetic data set. Another option we have is Q&A. What is A form of energy that flows through. Then we have textbook. How do we write in textbook?
The Admin: Lesson three, electricity, a form of energy that works through conductors. And then we translate, we can say electricity form actually convert Telugu into English. These are some of the ways in which we can create synthetic data sets. We have to come up with these approaches for indic ones because there is no other option right our indic data sets are locked inside banks inside the kata BBMP and the government agencies and I tried this last time also I thought because when I
was in school NCERT books were good I could read them I can't read books today not books I can't read NCERT books today I don't know how many of you have seen the latest NCERT books in
The Admin: E R T. Let's pick six class. But I was like, o my heart broke literally is this what we can at least see science? Okay, where does food come from? How do we even scan this or you have a QR code, what are signs and then wonderful a photograph immediately. where's the text to read? Half the stuff is just mixed inside some random images.
The Admin: You can't scan these basically immediately in activity and it might not be a surprise for you but it was surprise to me I met a person who in life has never seen out of 50 or something he only knows grades A B plus C and I was stunned that that generation is already here. reducing my sarcasm and surface. This is one way of creating our synthetic data set. Okay. this is a really really good matrix and this is something that we have seen in lot of papers 7030 split good. We can push
this and you can see the validation actually increases because data is actually good up to something like this. Moment we start crossing this point we'll start seeing that the risk increases. Right?
The Admin: So we can't have everything direct. So you need to make sure that somewhere around 30 to 50% is where our thing sit how much of direct data can he make right and we need to be aware of that. the India thread the sovereign now let's talk about Bangalore road sorry the sangra and indic and other data sets that are very very u u beautifully created by Indian government. And so this is Sundra then we have index then we have Maldad we have culture X we have fine web. So let's talk
about total headline when the data sets are launched this we are talking about SRA I think. Yeah only So,
01:50:00
The Admin: The headline the news article 34.5 billion Hindi tokens 16.3 billion Telugu tokens 12.5 billion Odia token this is the marketing this is the actual tokens inside okay so marketing versus push let's see why indic tend to look considerably bigger than they really are is a good illustration of this because it ships 251 billion tokens across 22 languages while roughly 65% of that count is synthetic material that was machine translated and translated out of English.
The Admin: What is verified spit reveals that the genine scarcity underneath these numbers syntax 16.3 billion token collapses to 3.7 falls from 12.5 to 1.5 and as if you toggle the synthetic padding you can actually see the real corus what is the issue the issue is that it involves I mentioned that also here let me see okay so this is sra I'm going to come back to it this Indic 3 verified 13.7 12.6 is not fied. So 11.9 count as synthetic which leaves only 23% verified. So it's not verified
udu and other thing also. So when they're counting the data set they're saying that my name is English data set which you can't just translate and there's a lot of crap question answer and other annotation that are inside.
The Admin: So actual content there is very very few but marketing wise these are really big data sets right so that's a big problem so it's generally not there then I wanted to click this button this is the amount of disparity we have the amount of English we have compared to Hindi Telugu or Bengali and verified only though again it's like they're what we're fighting against And it's not that 12.6 billion tokens for Hindi is not good enough for the model to learn Hindi. But the problem is
that you can see the culture, the history, everything that India stands for or whatever is captured is in some other English language is also there but it's kept in those languages right and when we do translation some sometimes good sometimes bad. Either the whole country decides to start speaking English then this table is not a worry.
The Admin: But if you do want to use our own languages then we need to make sure that we have some data on it. The other way of looking at this is that forget languages it's a context right the context from the American point of view or the west point of view is that there are these countries who are always going to be not in favor of how the western media thinks about. Then there are countries who want to have a independent identity. that country is a thing that their understanding of
history is the correct and that's how it started. But there are others who say that this is the monopolistic world. This is how the global economy should look So when we push those ideas, the ideas get pushed based on the data we have. So if all the data is coming from the west, that's the philosophy that moves forward. This is how the world should look like, That becomes a big genuine issue because from the west point of view, why should India do not get uranium?
The Admin: should not get uranium because India can use it for making nuclear weapons everyone has it but we should not make it others can so those are the insights that go inside the model and the model becomes bias in those things and you can't unfix them right there's no way you can go inside and change that behavior so it's not just that we don't have the data set we do not have our point of view data set if you've heard of Shankar and how he speaks about the country outside India
That's the mindset we need to have, European problems are our not European Something of that sort. Okay. Yeah. So, I also explained a quality filter is a representation of a decision.
The Admin: when you say that I'm going to increase the quality of the data set that means you're throwing away some of the data that you are not going to be training on. So this is also a big issue. For example, let's turn all the quality metrics off. So the committee will convene on Tuesday to review. Kindly do the needful and revert back on it earlier. Now people do speak like this. So when you're going to increase your block that gets dropped and that's how a lot of people speak in
messages. look at this please prepone the meeting. It is too much hectic otherwise grammar is wrong but that is how people do speak. If I don't train on it then model will not understand that this is how people do speak. You do lot of mistakes. So it's a question that's very critical for us to understand where do we add this connection that we can actually block it.
01:55:00
The Admin: If you have a script aware which means that always on is protected then some of those things will be protected because this is Hindic English sorry right so you are protecting it so that is the reason we had always on protected because otherwise these will get cropped if you add a very risky and there many examples which I like you to go through okay here we have prevenence open openness and license and let's look at that we have claude if I click on claude you're going to see
weights are closed data is closed recipe is closed then we have Gemini weights are closed data is closed recipe closed openi
The Admin: Okay, GP4 same thing then we have Mistral weights are open but data and recipes closed same for deepseek same for quen and same for other models also right and then we have the pile we have fine web and then we have download now the question is where do you want us to be and as we move you'll see that things are going to change so let's say you want us to be here so we are fully open we are because that depends on license how much you want to actually release. We're halfway there.
Let me zoom out. So, this is changing basically where do you want us to be and why should we tell claude? that's an emotional question that all of us need to answer that what do we actually make our model on?
The Admin: And finally the problem if you train on sundraa which is AI for baharat this is CC by4 which has its own interpretation which means that it is shippable with obligation every source is licensed 250 251 billion token we share alike we have a non-commercial limits can't commercialize it so the blend is shippable only when we actually honor each one of them so okay let's not train on sra where the hindi data where the indicator set if you do want to commercialize it at least I would
like to not commercialize but release the model T. MIT means that my model can be taken by somebody else and they can commercialize it. You't if you are using SRA fine web is fine, Ed is fine, stack is fine, Wikipedia dump no can't even use Wikipedia dump or something of that sort the restrictions.
The Admin: So every data that you pick scape news article book torren and foreign dumps you need to be very very aware of that what is your model train on and what I believe about patents and these things if you're not famous it's okay you can cheat but if you become famous and if your model becomes really good then this is going to be a nightmare so decide when do you want you're going to be famous or not now this is another important thing and this is slightly linked to the last assignment
that you had the same web page extracted in two different ways. A n approach if you strip away all the HTML at the part because this is how we get the news on internet or this is how we have the data on the internet.
The Admin: we will leave these kind of things that are left right so the garbage 60 tokens are there a good extractor would have cleaned it up and 100% usable stuff was there so this thing with a n approach you're going to get something like this whereas a good extractor is going to give us that 30 trillion token we talk about or the data we are talking about here or when I said that the quality of that sa and others is like Bangalore roads that's a difference that's the kind of cleaning
that they have done how cleaning happens in Indian roads right this is a cleaning that happens we wanted this right this is minister before the election is after election before election after election
The Admin: Okay, hope you get the idea. Okay, this is one of the last topic that you also again need to be aware of. Here we're talking about the best data set. So we have data set on which we are going to train spell mistakes and other stuff that garbage also but after that we have the last stage where we need to make sure we have a good quality data set and that's the middle training I spoke about. this middle train or anything how much of it is that we need now as I said people do not
share the recipe they do not say that okay this is good this is bad so all what you're seeing right now is a collection of hundreds of papers and going through them and then trying to make out how much of that was used so now when you start increasing the anal part you're going to
02:00:00
The Admin: that how much of data are we keeping for the nine first of all it can be 100 it can be some data set but based on all of this you're going to see that the GMSK and other levels other code numbers change so if I make 30% of the analing basically 60% is initial stuff 40% good 54.5 is what we get 60 62 63 64 65 good okay when dropping it it drops here.
The Admin: So somewhere around this number it is 25 15ish is what I've seen in models where the last 15 personal stage is kept for really high quality data and again how much of that is synthetic code and web you change this also you'll see that knowledge reduces and there also is a balance so what is that last stage again there is no recipe you have to figure out from the papers and read and just wait for one comment that somebody said and build on top of that. So yes, now this is also
very very important. We test the data recipe cheaply before we commit to one token. So what we do is we take a small model maybe 140 million parameter model. We train on raw common crawl and we see that what is the score we got.
The Admin: Then we do a dduplication and heristics and then we see the so same data we train a small model raw then you say I've done a good duplication I'm proud of what I've done we train on it and we prove it yes it's better then we do models code education some new algorithms for example then we run on education plus 20% code we see it increases slightly then we run on edu code and math and indices further so let us say we have 30 tokens we download from internet. You can't say this is
my algorithm. I'm going to train on it. That's not how it happens. You have to download a raw train your model a
The Admin: at least a small model on it and then figure out what are your benchmark on something right then you do one approach again train that's why it's not easy that's why and these things people don't even know so slowly you're going to see that as increasing a data set or quality of the data set you have to prove that you've increased the quality of data set and then we see slowly so if you don't do it then you're going to just hope that you're actually training on a data that is
going to be really good. All right, this I explained golden proxy held out test in our case. If it leaks then we have a big problem. this just shown in a graphical manner. How do we know that some part of our data was leaked? Now you see this canary GUI 42 A9 C1E.
The Admin: So after the model is trained we just send this to the model in GID if it predicts this that then it means it was actually trained on the data set. So generally we take a okay let me ask you this question we'll answer this yeah reverse sorry right so that's…
Sanjay Kumar: Ba gali.
The Admin: what we're doing basically so we know that in the benchmark this question was there as we asked a question and if
The Admin: The answer starts exactly from the answer then we know that it was cheating and it was part of the data set. All right. E where are we this one? Last thing. Okay. this is the most important slide and I hope that all of you are still aware and I want you to look at these two properly. And let me zoom out a bit a bit. So we have English sentence here we are talking about fertility is our real data budget and why a very very good fertility before when we start training a model is super
super important we have the English line here the model learns the structure of the language from a very large collection of data our token is one 15 tokens here one let's say this is our Hindi model partn now there we have 56 tokens which
The Admin: 3.7x then we have Tamil 107 Telugu 123 Bengali 66 I wanted to focus on this we have 100 billion token for Hindi but because our fertility was 3.7 we actually only trained on 4 ken clear on this even if I increase my data set to 500 billion for Hindi I'm only training on 100 billion words for Tamil that's 37 for Telugu that's 40 for Bengali that's 68 are we clear on this I'm actually using a real tokenizer here which is used in GBD4
02:05:00
The Admin: 4 right chronoer tokenizer the one that we wrote in era v4 in Bengali had we had 500 we would have trained on 292 total for telugu 203 for Tamil 186 and for Hindi 472 billion tokens that's how important fertility is you can say that I have 32 trillion tokens but how many of them are words really depends on a tokenizer right because when you're saying token that means the language is already converted into tokens.
The Admin: So that's why a really good tokenizer is a key for our success also because we can create a bad tokenizer and then train think that we have collected 500 billion tokens for indic language and we may just end with 40 billion actual words right so very very important slide for us to understand for sentence B sentence some examples are shown here but idea is that you need to know that it's a tokenizer that converts that data into tokens you can pick a really bad tokenizer which has a
fertility
The Admin: ity of 10 that means that you can collect 100 words multiply by 10 thousand so you can see I've collected thousand tokens that's nonsense that's where that sraha and other stuff cannot be just viewed from 251 billion billion tokens because which tokenizer which works all right now here is your assignment and this is sort of a subjective assignment and the scores are going to be decided based on how well you think about the whole This may also lead to some good ideas that I will
capture from what you're thinking and how you're saying. If you just copy paste what I've done in this section and repeat it back to me, you will get zero. I need to see ingenuity here. This is your chance to think and propose something that may actually become a paper also. Right? So I want you to think really hard about what we discussed today. What is assignment? Assume that you have to train a 40 billion parameter model.
The Admin: Chinchilla 40B into 20 means 200 billion immediately should hit your head which is as good as a gamma 4. Okay, I want to beat Gamma also, which means that I need to go on Olama anywhere. Gamma 4, this is easy access at least these benchmarks which is as good as so gamma 4 billion I'm going to compare with this guy. these are the benchmarks that I need to be good at. the first two lines you can see how much data it Assume you have to train a 40 billion parameter model. Chinchilla
200B blocked as good as gamma 4.
The Admin: Gamma 4 benchmarks you have seen here right so these are benchmarks you need to beat is really good in coding and agentic work gamma is good in agentic coding work so you're safe there but indic languages also so you need to now figure out how good gamma is on these indic languages which must be published somewhere and is India first this is the tricky part and this is why I made the assignment I somehow want you to think about how do you train a model that thinks from
India perspective first
The Admin: not the best perspective of the world, I don't know how many of this, but if you go to UK England and stay there, they have no guilt of doing anything to any country. 300 years they had a monopolistic control on nearly every country. They destroyed China literally giving drugs to make sure they can't compete, A lot of people were killed. Millions of lives were lost in Bengal. Nobody has any guilt. You go to Germany, they have guilt, but German Does not have that kind
of perspective. So, there are very different perspective about A filthy dirty Asian. So, the perspective is different. So, the thing I wanted to think about is how do you train a model that has the Indian at least Asian pers perspective, right?
The Admin: That is not to say that make it a chesh khan where he thinks everyone in Europe is a bad person. So do your research with your agent and then decide how your data look like? Where will you collect your data from and why for pretending post training in RL alignment? Where is your alignment going to come from? Where is your preference going to come from? how will you clean your data for the objective that I've defined here? Then how would you test your models against those
objective? Which are the What benchmark can you use for Indian perspective? H think about it. Then this is the most important part. What fertility would you target for different languages?
02:10:00
The Admin: Because we're seeing Indic, you can go to the top 10 Indian spoken languages based on the population that speaks it. Which languages will you focus on? I give that answer. Coding, science, math, and agentic task. And based on these numbers, what would you be your tokenizer size? How big your tokenizer is going to be? please read the question very carefully. What fertility would you target for different languages and coding and science and math and agentic task? So I'm not asking
fertility score only for indic languages. I'm asking fertility for math, fertility for coding, fertility for agent task, fertility for science. You need to think about how can I even talk about fertility for A question for you to think about and based on these numbers what is going to be tokenized size because one mind says that if my tokenizer is big, why would my tokenizer is big? If my tokenizer is big, then I can change this, right?
The Admin: Are you with me? if my tokenizer is big, I can increase this. I can take it. Krona already is really good. But chron is not good in At least Tamil and Telugu, right? If my tokenizer is good, I can hit the fertility higher or lower. I can take it closer to one. If I can do that, then my tokens are equal to number of words. If I can do that, then I mean it means that more data can be trained on the same tokens, more words will be there. Better way of saying That is what I want you
to read here. By the way, you think you have sent 500 billion tokens, but the model has seen only 37 billion tokens, That's the difference in fertility or that's the difference in tokens and words. Once you're sure of a number, work with the agent to write a report, upload it on Netifier so I can actually access it and share back with us. Our evaluation will be based on how much you have thought through. Longer submissions will result in lower scores.
The Admin: So if you give me a lightning kind of document where it's 12 pages of thoughts and discussions and I think you think or if you speak Mohammed Audi yeah team did good and you know that the pitch was not good and Sachin went out very early but don't do that very concrete simple to understand good graphs to explain what is happening so I can actually give you some scores on it. All right, that was today's session. long log. Now we open up for questions if you have any.
Mukund singh: So earlier you mentioned that once we have the data we also need to tag it and we train a classifier for it right but the classifier also needs some tag data already.
The Admin: Yes. Yeah.
Mukund singh: How do you solve that problem?
The Admin: How do you solve the problem? You can collect a small data set manually. Someone has to work somewhere.
The Admin: If done by LM what will we do? So humans we have to make a qualified data set and…
Mukund singh: Yeah. Got it. M got it.
The Admin: hope the model basically learns from Gone. Sep.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Sorry yeah in the Indic context right we do have lots of things to look at Vedas Vantas epics and various writings of the epics lots of books but one thing that's also stands out is that even…
Sandeep Kunkunuru: if we can't get the original version we have many variants of it that should be useful another thing is that originally it is your oral tradition originally it is not a extradition.
The Admin: Hold on.
The Admin: Who's Written by someone else giving it who comes into license can't where is the data?
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Yeah, that's a second part of the question.
The Admin: No, It's the first part of the question…
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Originalities No,…
The Admin: because as the Indian government needs to decide to create this data set and release it like what we've done in medicine the reason medical condition is really good in India and we have good medicines here is because government decided it's a national level priority that people need to work on me can't work on this there is problem…
Sandeep Kunkunuru: anthrop Yeah.
The Admin: but someone has to release
The Admin: All right.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Anthropic apparently bought and burnt books at millions of scale just to get enough information out of them. That's borderline unethical for they don't attribute the credit to the original authors. is there some method that is better?
02:15:00
The Admin: There is nothing better. it's all the line is always gray, right? you need to walk that gray line. AI is as important as nuclear technology and you're saying buying books and burning them is unethical where fable can today crack RBI and go into any Indian domain or defense and understand what India plans to do or give that information to Pakistan right so at a nuclear level we can't be talking ethics
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Yeah, I completely agree.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: This is the second part of the question where if it is originally a oral tradition, Vedas were also originally passed on as oral things not written down.
The Admin: H Vas is…
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Should we use audio or speech rather than text for training a truly sovereign model?
The Admin: how many words? Maximum million million tokens. That's not where the information is. That's where maybe some mantras are there right that's not a global compendium even the encyclopedia is way bigger than what we have in Vedas so don't just talk about that we're talking about every single historical impedent that has happened in India tipan was there in mess he fought the battle all of his documents if we can talk about Shakespeare why can't we talk about tulias that he wrote
something right so we're talking about all of that information not just that that information is stuck in India in books and other stuff
The Admin: which are not accessible actually NCI also what we teach in school they're literally not scannable and convert cannot be converted into good education material so someone has to work on it and that's assignment by the way for you to think I have no idea…
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Yeah. Yeah.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Just a last statement, If Nalanda is burned, we are screwed for our lifetime. Is that the state or is there something more?
The Admin: what to keep happening to all the culture right it is the responsibility of our culture to maintain it and…
Sandeep Kunkunuru: I mean, all the books that we had were burnt at one point in time.
The Admin: somehow reproduce it Rome was burned multiple times it's a bahana basically we can't say someone scooed us once so we don't have right and spine to start again come on
kamran shaik: Yeah. Can you go to the last calculation, the fertility Yeah.
kamran shaik: So whatever we see on the yellow is a fair approximation by the ratio, right? What if Yeah.
The Admin: W words Hindi 500 one of the best class tokenizer that only results into 37 billion tokens.
kamran shaik: Yeah. Yeah. So right it's just a fair approximation right what if we had more of Hindi or…
The Admin: Here we are saying we picked 500 billion tokens or…
kamran shaik: Indic data than English in the actual data set for training
The Admin: 100 billion tokens or 400 doesn't matter first step. Okay. If the tokenizer is bad those 500 will only mean 107 billion words. So it doesn't matter if you increase your data set from 20 billion to 500 billion here. Okay.
The Admin: Look at it like this. We think we have 130 billion tokens in Hindi but actually those are 30 billion words. So we increase it to 500 billion but we still have 100.
kamran shaik: No I understood that I'm saying…
kamran shaik: what if the representation of Hindi or Indic languages is more in the actual data set than that of English even Then this might be right.
The Admin: Where biggest data set of India right now is India for what I showed 251 billion. That's the biggest one that is there. Where do we get it from? Sraa 251, Indicop 920.
The Admin: And then remember the fertility is so low. Then we have Malad where some other text is there.
The Admin: Then we have culture X very few and then find overall internet right we don't have a source You're referring to a graph without talking about it.
kamran shaik: Got it.
Dattatreya Manjunath: so there were a few graphs that are not based just on the internal models right some graph that has spline I remember I wanted to know if I think there was some minima that was in range of 30 to 50% something like that I forgot which is but just want to know if that's solely datadriven or was there some hypothesis because of it the graph looks there was some line that's…
02:20:00
The Admin: How do I answer?
Dattatreya Manjunath: what I was I forgot…
The Admin: No, I've just published it.
Dattatreya Manjunath: which graph it was. Okay.
The Admin: Take a look and tell me.
The Admin: Still not 111 yet 28 4 minutes. One second. Let me open it so you guys can also see Available. mesh Only tokens can be sent to model.
Mahesh Sv: R. So when we talk about data set we need to think about the data format as well like what format we give to model no no I mean …
The Admin: But for each stage the data is different. Here we give me an example.
Mahesh Sv: what converting to tokens and everything right do we need to think about the format as well so example park or…
The Admin: What format are you saying? What is the
Mahesh Sv: JSON something we like okay so second question right so Microsoft recently released four model specifically in the release note right they said they only trained on the motion data is that cloud or…
The Admin: tokens you can't even…
The Admin: if it's JSON it has to be converted tokens and then we send JSONs yes because in coding it will be required so JSON is also sent it has to be raw text that you I'm not aware of it so I can't comment on it…
Mahesh Sv: open a does not do that what does mean JSON okay so it means that the data quality is high
The Admin: but it sounds like they took license and then train on it. That's it.
The Admin: 100%. That's
dharshan thaigu: Yeah there is a topic like quality over the quantity that here we have the DCLM science web baseline. so my question is is there anything like we have the raw web details and quality filter here. While choose the quality filter we are specification domain in the sense it is based for only for coding or some English literature.
The Admin: raw data to quality in general. Yes.
dharshan thaigu: So that is why we are using the DCLM or fine web or it is in general we using for raw data to qualify quality based data in general it is Another question is for a pre- snapshot u for a quantity data we have been removing some of the data while refinding that while removing is there any margin as you said we can take from 2014 to 2026 the entire data details and we want to remove one specific thing if you are not aware of…
dharshan thaigu: what we are removing then the entire junk of 2024 has been removed completely. So how can we set the margin even with the 2020 in the covid we have some preconumption we just want to remove that section is there any margin that we can predefine here What can we do?
The Admin: We need linguist for that.
The Admin: We need data engineers for that. We need a lot of people to think and come up with the strategies. I presented a problem that I do not have a solution for it. These are the problems that are real that we need to be aware of.
dharshan thaigu: Okay.
The Admin: You can ask a question. Yeah.
Gitesh Grover: Shall I go ahead? So in the assignment you mentioned agentic tasks right?
Gitesh Grover: Can you el elaborate more on that? Is it related to SFT
The Admin: No, no,…
The Admin: no. for example this one and there are agentic benchmarks that I wanted to think about. So when we say what fertility would you target for different languages and coding and science and math and agentic task, So we're talking about agentic task here. So if you go to for example open AI and look at their release, you'll see that they talk about agents last exam.
The Admin: So this is one of the benchmark that is there.
The Admin: So these are the benchmarks that we're targeting right. So you need to now look at a data set for these benchmarks and then whenever we have these agentic tasks these are the kind of words that are used my fertility for these should be high or…
Gitesh Grover: Thank you.
The Admin: let me give you another example you help everyone actually. So markdown PDF or in fact let me ask Char good math questions.
02:25:00
Gitesh Grover: Yeah. Heat.
The Admin: So this is how markdown for math looks like. Now if I'm saying I'm good in math,…
Gitesh Grover: Yeah.
The Admin: I need to be really good here because this is how math is presented to model, And if you just see sum underscore n equal to one frack and if these are not in the tokens then there's no way we can be really good in math because it will just take so much time just to convey the same message. Now I can go to mark to PDF and paste it there and you'll see that it's still rendering. Okay, let me ask if it will render it also. Okay, they just
Tejaskumar Reddy J: With respect to your assignment so far we've just looked into conversion of different language corpus into tokens.
Tejaskumar Reddy J: Can I include content or talk about a form of using tokens to develop reasoning but is not developed on text.
The Admin: What is the question again?
Tejaskumar Reddy J: So far we've just looked into u tokenizing textual data right. there's a recent work which I came across where models can develop reasoning but the data set is synthetic and it's not developed on text. can I talk about it and include it in the assignment?
The Admin: As long as you're answering these four questions, I'm okay.
Tejaskumar Reddy J: Okay. Yeah.
The Admin: Okay. What's that?
Max: Can I go ahead?
The Admin: Yeah, go ahead.
Max: So basically my question is can you scroll to the fertility dial? Yeah. So this seems intuitive but if you look the actual constraint is the number of words and not the number of tokens. let's say we have an Wikipedia page…
The Admin: Correct.
Max: 
Max: which has 100 words. So that's our constraint and then we can design our tokenizer and that can give us 120 tokens or 160 tokens. So it seems like it's the other way around because we only download let's say Wikipedia pages or common crawl or GitHub or those kind of things and even if you scroll up to the data set you shown the indic web and culture x they have 20 billion tokens. So they may have a different tokenizer we might have a different tokenizer.
Max: So the number of tokens can be different right.
The Admin: Correct.
Max: So the constraint is the number of words not the tokens. so that dial that you shown below I'm asking question that isn't the constraint the number of words and…
The Admin: You're making a point or asking a What? Answer is yes.
Max: not the tokens.
Max: Yeah. Okay. Enter.
The Admin: That's why I made and…
The Admin: showed this also. Fertility is a real budget data target. Okay. Nanda
Nandha Kumar: the model I'm asking a farfetched question we are training model on different billion parameters right starting from two five n billion parameters how does it have impact on our latency and one example use case which we are solving at I'm working for fourth. So we have 30 to 40 plus data sources which are in different formats. So right now we are planning on orchestrating several agents to handle this scenario. But what is that This is training a model holistically on all the
data sets which are available right now.
Nandha Kumar: lots are it has to be frequently trained training pipeline has to be set and as you said even the math equations we can't just like that feed the math it has to be processed the way you showed it and…
Nandha Kumar: so what are the pros and cons of each of this I'm just thinking out loud and latency come into picture because when we go for multi-agentic framework…
The Admin: I'll stop you here.
Nandha Kumar: if you are not using an opt Okay.
The Admin: I'll stop you here. You have asked four five different questions and they are not linked all at all. When we speak about 29 and other thing the reason we did it is because the computation is different. So when we are training three,…
02:30:00
Nandha Kumar: Okay.
The Admin: When we're training 120, all the other models are gone. So every time we're talking about latency of one only or three only or eight only or 1B and of course 120 billion parameter model is going to be the slowest of them. So what is the latency question here?
The Admin: Bigger the hardware required to match the same amount of time. What's the question on Latency is the amount of time it takes to process one token.
Nandha Kumar: But on a follow-up note there are quantization techniques right they condense like a two bit or…
The Admin: That is a inferencing question.
Nandha Kumar: four bites.
The Admin: Training I'm ask if we're talking about training here.
Nandha Kumar: Could you come again?
The Admin: What is the latency with respect to training here? Are you clear the question is wrong? Latency refers to inferencing and not training. we are not discussing inferencing.
Nandha Kumar: Inferencing name. So, I'm just saying. Yeah. Sure.
The Admin: Inferencing is a completely separate chapter. We're sticking to the training part. Then you said that instead of collecting data set there are a lot of other coding data sets we can use to train on. Answer is yes we can do that. The question is that if most of these data sets have the same problem solved. We wasted tokens on the data set in a way where you can actually train on something else.
The Admin: So in code we have let's say the stack v2 and star coder and let's say there's a 20% overlap between them would you like to clean it up or would you like to just still train on it if you have money you can do it if you don't have then you have to clean it so you have to have a consolidated matt data set where the dduplication has happened that is why we discuss the dduplication part when we dduplicate we make sure that we are not training on the same data again and
Nandha Kumar: I'm talking about company specific documents for instance let's say specific documents design standards guidelines etc which though if we use standard LM and rack pipeline it may take time let's say I'm talking about let's say thousands of documents in that case I'm just speaking There's no question. Sure. Yeah. Sure.
The Admin: Consolidate your question and ask again, Okay. Come on.
kamran shaik: So when we talk about raw data,…
kamran shaik: it can be multiple Wikipedia pages or books or anything as such, right? But in order to create a training sample of let's say 4096 in length,…
The Admin: Correct.
kamran shaik: we will have to split the data set into that particular length. Correct? So for pre-training does it really matter that we have to logically cut it at the end of sentence or…
kamran shaik: at the end of paragraph or it can spill over as well.
The Admin: Not still over.
The Admin: Not at all.
kamran shaik: And we can probably train it in SFT for making it coherent with the Okay.
The Admin: Yes. Okay.
Ravil Kashyap: yeah so given that we'll have varied sources of data set right languages stem coding and whatn not so when we calculate the fertility rate the denominator is dependent on the number of words right so I mean the way I calculate my number of words may be different so is there a standard to it or…
Ravil Kashyap: fertility rate is kind of subjective to how I …
The Admin: No, there's a standard benchmark.
The Admin: It's called Florence only bit.
Ravil Kashyap: because as you were showing the markdown for math,…
Ravil Kashyap: my notion of word may be different over there. It may not just be split by space, right?
The Admin: there are benchmarks to just answer that question.
The Admin: So because everyone follows the same benchmark then there's no problem and it is called explor 200.
The Admin: So because they have released it then we can just use the same one to calculate.
Ravil Kashyap: Okay, because the previous assignment we got some scores…
Ravil Kashyap: but I don't know if that's really valid because my word split may be different. Okay, got it.
Ravil Kashyap: And the other question I had was on benchmarks itself.
The Admin: In some benchmarks there are test,…
Ravil Kashyap: because these things are open sourced there may be leakage of data that was actually used for benchmark right so we see many models listed in the benchmarking website Okay.
02:35:00
The Admin: train and validation all three are shared. In some benchmarks Where it is there is a possibility of cheating. But those benchmarks are not the only decider of the model. So even if someone cheats on let's say someone cheats on the model and
The Admin: model is really bad. They will get caught.
Ravil Kashyap: But in the leaderboard it still shows up. but yeah, got it.
The Admin: No, it's not even possible to show up in the leaderboard. Believe me, you will only find the real high quality models there by cheating. one has actually beaten any benchmark. They can be high in top 100 but not in top four or five. That's it.
Ravil Kashyap: Okay.
Athvaith Krish: Hey, a generic question here. So why do big players or anyone trying to train a single model that outperforms in all the fields instead of specifically training for a particular coding language a particular field.
The Admin: I didn't get the question again, please.
Athvaith Krish: So all we are also training a one model that performs well in across all the coding taskers or language specific taskers sales marketing…
Athvaith Krish: but why people are not training a specific model that one let's say Python it does well so that the size of the model will also reduce specifically targeting a particular field All right.
The Admin: So there are model…
The Admin: which are trained specifically for specific jobs this is trained for gamma moving functions or for agentic purpose. But generally what people have seen is that if a model is really good in physics it will be really good in coding automatically. If the model has a marketing understanding then it can code also or if the model is really good in coding then you can write a better graph for a marketing. So these are cross- linked domain expertise that are required.
The Admin: There's no domain in the world where math is not there. You can't even tell me a domain where math is not involved.
Athvaith Krish: So we are also trying to train a single model that solves multiple functionalities,…
Athvaith Krish: right? Understood.
The Admin: Correct? Because everything advanc is a cross domain problem only and…
The Admin: you cannot tell me one domain which is not cross domain…
Athvaith Krish: But if you specifically train for a particular use case we can reduce the size of the model and…
The Admin: which is gamma only designed to select which function to call for what task then the model size can be extremely clear definition of what the model needs to do then it's fine right okay
Athvaith Krish: it's not finetuning on top of the model. It's like while pre-training only we'll categorize the data and specifically train on that particular instance. Thanks.
The Admin: Yeah. Yeah.
Dattatreya Manjunath: Yes Ron so I was earlier referring to the two-stage training. I was looking at the graph and just wanted to understand what is the reservation of best data for analing doing to the learning rate there.
The Admin: A high quality data because we kept full data set as a high quality.
Dattatreya Manjunath: Yeah. Right.
The Admin: These are the BBC level, the really really high quality language level, research paper level, that kind of data set that is learning rate.
Dattatreya Manjunath: But what is that even doing to the learning rate there? I couldn't see any changes in the learning rate. If I change basically the graph that is reducing I thought the trend had some correlation with the fraction of best words that you're using for running link no…
The Admin: that there's no learning rate we discussed today.
Dattatreya Manjunath: if you go to basically that graph the curve is just search for I believe two stages.
The Admin: Which graph is it? I opened it now for you. Did you not open it?
Dattatreya Manjunath: I am looking at the same thing.
The Admin: Tell me text above it somewhere some text here. Yeah.
Dattatreya Manjunath: The section says save the best data for last. Right? So if I change the best data reserved for analing, it's not doing anything to the learning rate. I mean basically just this is like the graph here that is basically how the learning rate reduces when we change from bulk training to analing right so the fraction of words best words…
The Admin: Correct…
Dattatreya Manjunath: if we reserve for analing versus if we use everything regardless that's not doing anything to learning rate so I was just trying to okay Okay.
02:40:00
The Admin: because not even introduce learning rate properly in the class. I will not talk about it.
Dattatreya Manjunath: No. I thought there was some correlation in this particular graph. That's why I said okay.
The Admin: No no it is there but I have not covered it.
Dattatreya Manjunath: Yeah. I did not see any trans.
Dattatreya Manjunath: That's fair class.
The Admin: Yeah, sorry.
Saurabh Deshpande: Yeah, my question is around comparing full training of LMS with fine-tuning. So the goals we have set for this training is it possible to achieve using the finetuning of web opensource models.
The Admin: Fine tuning of open source model. no, not possible.
Saurabh Deshpande: So is it the tokenizer bottleneck?
The Admin: No, it's a DNA.
The Admin: The training sets a DNA. So the DNA is for European mindset is for English is for thinking non-math…
The Admin: then it's not possible to fix in the SFP or later stages right once we let's say give birth to a dog there's no way we can convert that into fox or a lion ever the DNA session. Okay.
Saurabh Deshpande: Mh Okay. X
Sachin Bharadwaj: Yeah Rohan in the chinchilla paper right it tells you about if the flops are fixed what is the optimal loss given the parameter size of the model right prior do we…
Sachin Bharadwaj: what loss we should stop at for example I know there are 11 different ways of saying the same thing roughly statistically so it's minus log 11 that's the loss right but is it across including all the gen coding and everything is there some histic on that And there's no universal lower bound that okay.
The Admin: No, it's on the training loss only.
The Admin: Chingel only talks about training. where do we stop? So, it's a question that you can ask a charge and ask where are the Frontier LLMs are somewhere around.9 to 7 that's the less than one is the target basically last time we could go to 1.5ish lowest there more mathematically there's no bound
The Admin: Yes, there is benefit
Sachin Bharadwaj: And second thing that I was asking is I mean the way we learn maths of let's say any particular niche right we have class 1 to 12 then we have undergrad PhD stuff like that right is curriculum set in the same way for training is more at a high level let's say we directly give it a PhD level data set and it learns completely is there any benefit of setting a subcurriculum like that and going through the training phase Okay.
The Admin: And that is what we also tried to do but it's very hard compared to how it sounds because given the time the amount of data that we have how do we classify that into nursery first second third fourth that is where I was hoping the NCRT and Indian books will help but they are crap literally they are not scannable or even usable but that really definitely helps.
Sachin Bharadwaj: And also is there public data set that gives traces with the rewards and all that open it.
The Admin: Yeah there a lot of data set you can look at GMSK math graders luminina math and code unit test I was the only person working with also on the call everyone left me alone all alone in my room okay SI
Sachin Bharadwaj: And in V4 we stopped at SFT. where do you stop there and laugh? Okay, thanks.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: For the classifier, what papers or models would you recommend? Okay.
The Admin: you need to do some research on it.
The Admin: It's a part of the assignment. are I've not seen any latest result on it. So as I said that is the secret sauce people are not talking about it.
Sandeep Kunkunuru: Right. Okay. Understood.
chirag Tagadiya: So you are talking about the evaluation data set. So you are saying the Google will be spending 100 times more than on the test we are spending. So my question is because we are training model in an iterative manner like 1 billion and then 8 and then 32 and then 120 billion. So your testing example will be also comparative to what model you're training like what I meant is for example billion training parameter model you will have the very easy kind of testing criteria…
The Admin: Yeah. Good.
The Admin: That is correct.
chirag Tagadiya: but for okay so we
The Admin: I've not been on coding data sets a lot.
The Admin: It doesn't make sense to test on coding. So yes, that's correct.
chirag Tagadiya: And…
chirag Tagadiya: then how we are picking up the examples for example in the 120 billion parameter model when you train on era V before.
02:45:00
chirag Tagadiya: So how you pick up the example for example but you have to be very okay I remember you saying something in one of the class in era V4 that you will create an example in such a way that it will
The Admin: subsets of these big benchmarks.
The Admin: Ideally, we should be picking subsets of these big benchmarks, not the full one. This full one is going to be very expensive. So, why don't we pick let's say at least 5% of it?
chirag Tagadiya: it will cover multiple different scenarios which if you don't use it like that you may use a four example for that is it something related to that let's say for example you are creating evolution data set …
The Admin: I'm not able to recolor…
The Admin: what you just said.
chirag Tagadiya: but you create a example in a smart smart way such that for one example will cover multiple Test case scenarios. Okay.
The Admin: one example. No, that's not what we did. We had multiple examples for multiple scenarios and that helped us understand okay how good are we in that domain.
Athvaith Krish: here one dumb question. So if we have a open source available model like gamma and if we take that by weights and train the parameter with different tokenizer can we do that and then we're training the llm from scratch. So after taking the tokenizer should be the same.
The Admin: The training has to happen from scratch. Yes. If you change the tokenizer,…
Athvaith Krish: Okay.
The Admin: the model has from scratch. Reveal.
Ravil Kashyap: the reasoning tags that gets generated in some of the models.
Ravil Kashyap: At what stage do we introduce that?
The Admin: Start from the SFT stage.
Ravil Kashyap: So it's a decision that we have to take whether the model has to reason or it has to generate the thought reason tags or not is it from s Okay.
The Admin: We provide deplo a data set with reasoning.
The Admin: attack. So it learns to start reasoning.
Ravil Kashyap: And nowadays models allow us to set reasoning level, right? it's a par input parameter that we pass along so that
The Admin: That means we force it to not use a tag. It's all So more the token,…
Soma Korada: Rohan, did I hear it right? when you mentioned that more the tokens, faster the training.
The Admin: faster the training. Yes.
Soma Korada: More the words, faster the training. Just 10 billion 52 billion 130.
The Admin: So yeah in this example focus How many words have I train on here? What is the total tokens?
Soma Korada: So you're in that budget of 130 billion tokens, you're able to understand 52 billion words of that language.
The Admin: Because the tokenizer was like that.
Soma Korada: Which means that your fertility has to be as low as possible, one word equal to one token is the ideal thing.
The Admin: Yeah. Yeah.
Soma Korada: But then you mentioned in the assignment for the agentic that task the fertility should be higher wasn't that the thing okay got it Okay.
The Admin: I use a inverted term for me.
The Admin: Higher fertility is one not 10. Okay. Correct.
Ravil Kashyap: Yeah so earlier we had this temperature concept right and since we started seeing reasoning model the temperature probably does not mean much right so I'll read about it but just wanted to understand what was the thought process for temperature not being a parameter anymore.
The Admin: Earlier we had to force the model to be created but now they're so good that we can just ask them to be creative.
The Admin: What happens temperature you are a good boy. So good can become great can be nice can be other things. So when the model predicts good it's not predicting only good it's also predicting some other words which are similar to good. So temperature allows us to select those other words also. So we dynamically change the overall creativity but that leads to a lot of nonsensical scenario also especially in the enterprise…
02:50:00
The Admin: because enterprise want determinism. I said I want B Temperature settings allow the can be B small B capital B in different language. That's why it's completely removed…
Ravil Kashyap: So it's not really related to the reasoning.
The Admin: because it makes the model slightly more probabilistic.
Ravil Kashyap: effort that we see these days. It's just a side effect that temperature is no longer required.
The Admin: Yes. Yes.
The Admin: It's more into softmax the final token prediction. So I did not understand your question.
Soma Korada: Sorry Roman we are assuming here the 52 billion tokens words are all distinct words and not some words being byproduct of other words. so basically if say words they are extended form of the base words then we don't really need to cover more words right.
The Admin: I still don't understand.
Soma Korada: So say yeah correct.
The Admin: Just wait once. I can count.
The Admin: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 tokens. Nine words in GBT3 that is equal to 106 tokens. GBT4 that reduces 66. GBT 5 that reduces 19 tokeniz tokenizer.
Soma Korada: So this is on the training I understand Rohan lesser the tokens the faster the training it would be …
The Admin: Let's say my context window is 4096 and…
Soma Korada: but in the quality of the model this has no say right it's just that the model is using more tokens to mean the same thing but the no Okay.
The Admin: My token is 10 times back so it could only see 400 words so while talking about India I could only cover the initial 400 words…
Soma Korada: Okay.
The Admin: if the tokenizer were really good I
The Admin: could have stressed and I could have hit the economics also of India on Wikipedia page. So the amount of context it builds up reduces drastically based on tokenizer because tokconizer is bad.
The Admin: It has not even seen 4,000 words of continuous talking about India because that would mean that I have to send in these many tokens.
Soma Korada: Yeah, that's…
Soma Korada: what I was thinking if they cover all of the grammar or all of the possible words for that language, we are still good. and if those rest of the words are just extension of these 400 words, we should be good. But if any of the extra words are totally new words then we are missing some understanding. Is that the right inclusion?
Soma Korada: 
The Admin: No, completely not.
The Admin: Can you talk about quantum mechanics for half an hour?
Soma Korada: No. Yeah.
The Admin: You can't speak English, right? Then why can't you speak for half an hour?
Soma Korada: Got it. Okay. Okay.
The Admin: Knowledge is not because the tokenizer is bad.
Soma Korada: Got it.
Soma Korada: So it has not learned anything in that space. It just knows common words.
The Admin: Yes, it can speak…
Soma Korada: Okay.
The Admin: but it can't like Yes.
Soma Korada: Makes sense of new domain. Makes Got it. Thank you.
The Admin: All If you have any other questions, please let me know. I'm stop stopping recording here. Krishna.
krishna rao: Yeah, one question.
